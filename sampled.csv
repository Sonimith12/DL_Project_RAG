Eszopiclone,Insomnia,"""Works pretty well after using it for several years. Works best on a totally empty stomach. Have had a glass of wine after taking 3 mg and for some reason it doesn&#039;t work as well for me. I wake up after only a couple of hours. All in all, I think it works great. I don&#039;t have the memory loss that I sometimes experience with Ambien."""
Trintellix,Depression,"""Female, 46yrs, depression for ~10yrs. I went on Trintellix 10mg at the end of January and from the very first day, I&#039;ve been dizzy and nauseous. Yesterday, the nausea was at its worst. I also take Vyvanse 50mg for ADD and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5mg for high blood pressure plus another BP med. Shortly after going on Trintellix, I started to develop bruising on my upper thighs as well as itching. I think as I scratch, I end up bruising and it looks awful. I contacted my doc and am still waiting for a reply. Hopefully, I&#039;ll be taken off of it and will go back to Cipralex and Wellbutrin even though my libido has improved somewhat. At least I&#039;m not crying at the drop of a dime as happens when I don&#039;t take any meds at all. Good luck everyone!"""
Lamotrigine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I am 58 years old and diagnosed last year with mild bipolar disorder, agoraphobia, anxiety.  I felt very happy most of my life although having behavioral problems, and didn&#039;t start having real problems until I was 50. I tried Wellbutrin and it gave me hives. Celexa made me so wired that I couldn&#039;t sleep and felt like I was going crazy. Effexor worked but I was tired all day.  Lamictal was miraculous. I have taken it for a year. It gives me energy, I feel happy and motivated.  I don&#039;t feel angry anymore. I LOVE it. I gave it a 9 because it gives me memory problems which I do not like. But I feel that it is really a lack of concentration. So I try harder to concentrate and it helps when I do more mental things, like read."""
Imiquimod,Human Papilloma Virus,"""I am female and was diagnosed with genital warts when I was 22 years old and I thought my life was over. I was prescribed Aldara cream and my gyno told me to use just a tiny bit and to try to ONLY put it on the warts and not the surrounding skin. I remember feeling a little soreness but nothing that I couldn&#039;t handle. I had a mild case of warts near the opening of my vagina and they flattened after a week and were completely cleared after 2.5 weeks... I couldn&#039;t believe it! Want to know the best part? I am 33 years old and they have never come back! Turns out my life wasn&#039;t over after all!"""
ParaGard,Birth Control,"""I was very nervous about getting the Paragard IUD after reading many reviews. I decided I still wanted to try it and honestly insertion was not painful at all. I read from so many different reviews of woman describing it as the worst feeling they&#039;ve experienced. I was also advices to take ibuprofen before my appointment which I didn&#039;t do. I just felt pressure and not pain. I guess I was lucky! I don&#039;t really cramp and when I do it&#039;s not too painful. Prior to the Paragard my periods were very light which has changed a bit. They&#039;re not too heavy. Overall happy I went through with it!"""
Primidone,Benign Essential Trem,"""Tremors seem to be getting worse. I take 2 a day. Just turned 70. Have had tremors for many years.
Maybe I should ask my doctor is there is something else for me to try."""
Acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine / salicylamide,Migraine,"""I buy Pain-Aids brand at local Quik-Trip that&#039;s about the only place I know to buy pain-aids. A box of 12 packages, with 2 pain-aids in each package is $2.99. They are the best for relieving headaches and other pains. They do not upset my stomach, even on an empty one.  I have tried many pain killers, even prescription, and these are by far the best. Easy to purchase if there is a Quik- Trip nearby because I have not found them in Walmart, Kmart or any other drug store. Once I found them at a health food store in Akron, Ohio which was great because I couldn&#039;t find a Quik-Trip. It has all 4 ingredients, aspirin, acetaminophen, caffeine, salicylamide. I give the highest rating 10."""
Propranolol,mance Anxiety,"""I&#039;m 43 years old and have had a chronic stage fright that I&#039;d rather DIE than speak in public. I learned last week that I&#039;d be lecturing in front of 50 or so people all Saturdays of March and April 2016. My initial thought was to RESIGN! But I can&#039;t for economic reasons, besides I&#039;m doing well here and respected by everyone. Long story short, I googled for quick relief for stage fright as I&#039;ve suffered for this since I was 11. Trembling voice is my biggest problem. Inderal is a modern day miracle! I poppped in 2 tabs 10mg each an hour before my presentation made sure i&#039;ve full stomach. When my turn came, no raising heart! AND NO MORE TREMBLING VOICE!!!! I feel i can conquer all now! This was just yesterday and it felt great!"""
Tioconazole,Vaginal Yeast Infection,"""I usually get the yeast infection pill from my doctor, but it was so bad over the weekend that I couldn&#039;t wait. I decided to try monistat 1 and I have a love/hate relationship with it! It burned and itched so badly after inserting the ovule, but I&#039;m not sure if part of that had to do with the cream. I ended up wiping the cream off with the cooling pads and not trying anything else to help with the itch. The itching and burning were worse than the original yeast infection but only for about a day. Other than that, it cured the infection and I am feeling much better! I will probably try the 3 day formula next time for less aggravation."""
Tramadol,ibromyalgia,"""Twenty plus years with Fibromyalgia and depression. Pristiq works best as my antidepressant. Tramadol very helpful for early morning stiffness, muscle pain. It takes about 30 minutes to work. Northstar manufacturer capsule does not allow me to nap in the afternoon for some reason which I like and is my only (positive) side-effect. Zydus manufacture pill makes me sleepy by afternoon and a headache. I would advise trying different manufacturers although the inactive ingredients don&#039;t seem to be very different. I wonder about that.
I was four years on oxycodone 10 mg and although I was able to work, it definitely had more of a &quot;narcotic&quot; effect and not as helpful as Tramadol. I am not susceptible to addiction and had no trouble withdrawing from oxycodone."""
Risperidone,Bipolar Disorde,"""This is ahorrid med. Made me hallucinate and tons of other stuff"""
Isotretinoin,Acne,"""In Junior High all of a sudden my face just erupted in acne. You could tell people were staring. I hated looking in the mirror. It&#039;s remarkable how fast all the acne disappeared. This medication was a real life saver. My dad didn&#039;t have access to this medicine and from 12-25 he was absolutely covered in acne. So grateful I have this stuff 
Side effects to note: 
VERY dry lips 
Dry skin 
Back pain"""
Ethinyl estradiol / norgestrel,Birth Control,"""This birth control isn&#039;t bad, defiantly not the best but not the worst. Before Cryselle I had almost perfect skin with occasional breakouts here and there, but I break out on my chin often now. It&#039;s not bad and it goes away in a couples days or so, but before the pill that almost never happened. It made my period a little shorter by a day or so. I do have very bad mood swings, but I&#039;ve always been kind of a moody person so it might just be me. But other than that this pill is good, I haven&#039;t gained any weight, I don&#039;t spot, I occasionally get mild headaches... But nothing a Advil couldn&#039;t fix."""
Ethinyl estradiol / levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""I have been taking this birth control for 3 days and I can already tell what the side effects are, I have horrible nausea and have been vomiting, My legs and feet are swollen, I have started getting acne on my jawline, and I have been having the worst cramps ever. Gonna stick with it for a week until my dr gets back to prescribe new medication."""
Victoza,"Diabetes, Type 2","""I have been on Victoza for 3 weeks now. Started with the 0.6 dose for 1 week then moved to the 1.2 for two weeks. I have lost 17.1 pounds in that time. My blood sugars are also greatly improved. I whole-heartedly recommend this medicine to any one who can handle the side-effects, which have not been too bad at all for me."""
Belviq,Obesity,"""I am looking for a jump start on my weight loss and my Dr. prescribed Belviq for 60 days. I started taking the pills 7/31/15 and return to the Dr.today 8/7/15 and have lost 1lb.
I was 360lb and now 359lbs. I only take 1 per day because I was afraid of side effects reviews I read.
I&#039;m not a diabetic and have not had any side effects.
So far so good. And planning overtime to increase to 2 pills per day."""
Plavix,Heart Attack,"""I had a heart attack July 7th this year. What a surprise that was. I had wonderful doctors and they prescribed Plavix. I was told I will need to take it for the rest of my life. I had two stents and damage to the back of my heart. I feel much better now and will for sure take my Plavix."""
Tussionex Pennkinetic,Cough,"""This is the best cough syrup hands down in the country. It works very, very well and no bad taste. Very pricey, but worth it. Some doctors will not write for it. I think that is poor professionalism for those who refuse. Yes some will seek and/or abuse but the benefit of the doubt should be given for something that works this well. Highly recommended."""
Bupropion,Smoking Cessation,"""Was taking wellbutrin XL 150mg once a day. I started taking this drug for what was thought to be mild anxiety (which was from caffeine withdrawal) and to quit smoking. The first few weeks were ok (prob because my body was getting use to the lack of caffeine). After a while I began to feel really anxious due to physical symptoms I felt, ringing in my ears, trouble sleeping, lack of memory and attention, reflux, constipation, hemorrhoids, heart flutters, constant trembling, extreme anger and the inability to calm down, fear of being alone, and constant fear of dying. I have been off of the medicine for 7 days and feel great. Pay attention to any symptoms you feel and tell your doc."""
Ethinyl estradiol / norgestimate,Birth Control,"""I was on Tri-Sprintec for 2 months and it completely cleared my cystic acne. I had terrible, terrible acne for about 7 years before that and it completely scarred my cheeks. it even seemed to help with the scars a bit. I also lost a bit of weight on this pill. The only problem I had was that I would get a 2 day migraine on the first pack of pills. I switched and realized the headaches were a lot better than the other medicine so I am now switching back to Tri-Sprintec. This is by far the best birth control I&#039;ve been on."""
Lorazepam,Anxiety,"""I was on 1mg of Ativan at night as needed. It worked pretty well. Once the side effects went away (a little sleepy and off-balance) I started taking half a pill in the daytime whenever I felt stressed and it seemed to last most of the day. It also helps whenever I feel angry at work. If not for Ativan, I would probably have quit my job or knocked someone out."""
Escitalopram,Depression,"""Made me feel like a zombie..Foggy feeling in head.  Not good for the sex life.    Sleepy all day long; couldn&#039;t get out of bed.  I woke up just to eat and went back to bed.   Stopped after 6 weeks.; switched to Wellbutrin with good results."""
Seroquel XR,Depression,"""I have been on a few antidepressants for 11 years with only fair results. My Doctor started me on some Seroquel XR 200mg at bedtime over the last few weeks. This medication not only has helped me with the terrible side effects when you come off many of the typical SSRI but I am sleeping and my depression has improved from a 2 out of 10 to 7 out of ten. Sometimes, SSRI medication side effects are stated as minor but they can be very severe at times. More Doctors should know about Seroquel XR and the great results when stopping antidepressants."""
Lorcaserin,Weight Loss,"""Started taking just today!  I couldn&#039;t believe how full I got at lunch. I am making sure to eat a little something low cal, low fat and  low carbs every two hours.  Never hungry,  Slightly tired and a little bit of nausea after I ate lunch.  However,  I&#039;m very excited how I end up in a week."""
Doxycycline,Acne,"""Been on doxycycline for 2 weeks and seen great improvement. I am 37 and have suffered from moderate cystic acne, blackheads, and pustules since 18. In the past year, the acne was also on my chest, back and I had developed an embarrassing acne scar beard. Have tried everything topical (Retin A, Differin gel, Clindamax, etc.) and some things worked but caused damage to my skin or only moderate results. This antibiotic is the best thing thus far. Chest and back acne cleared completely in a week, scars even look lighter. Acne on face is reduced significantly, a tiny pimple hear and there. Taking with food and eating yogurt/probiotics midday to keep good bacteria."""
Amitriptyline,Insomnia,"""I have had sleeping issues since I was very young. This medication is the best thing to help me sleep."""
Amerge,Migraine,"""I had MVA over 20 years ago leaving me w  chronic migraines complete w nausea/ vomit, but I get the diarrhea issue frequently as well. They often begin w frequent urination. 
Amerge helps usually in first 10 minutes (only occasionally need the second dose In a day) I still usually need to relax in dark calm area but symptoms are more manageable. One problem is the dr usually only order 9/month which is not enough for a CHRONIC migrainer"""
Methylnaltrexone,"Constipation, Drug Induced","""Before Relistor/or Movantik.,  anyone in this world experience trying to pass a friggin baseball?? Literally true.. I was on a miracle drug called  Movantik for 1 month $435.00!!!  And they are pills,1 pill on empty stomach with a bottle of water say 8 am, on pot within 30 minutes, oh what a relief it is!!  My insurance wouldn&#039;t cover it  :(  because its not on their formulary list,  but will cover Relistor for $2000.00.. but if this works like Movantik it&#039;s my miracle drug..I&#039;m just scared of the side effects from Relistor,  I had slight side effects  with Movantik. Such as withdraw symptoms,  not everyday , so wish me luck, my 1st dose is tomorrow morning. 7/14/17"""
Pristiq,Depression,"""Started with Wellbutrin 300mg - I was way to agitated -- went to Cymbalta - loved it except for the lack of ability in the sack. Went to Celexa - worked okay stayed on it for 3 months but never felt anything. So during the 3 months doctor added Wellbutrin - does not help. Celexa made me feel - no sorry it didn&#039;t make me feel anything but overall in some ways I kind of liked not feeling but that is not life. So the doctor changed to Pristiq -- WOW I feel alive, energetic, really great. I hope this continues. Oh yea .. no lack in the sack on this one. My real message here is that I hope each of you continues to work with you doctor and find the right medicine."""
Nitrofurantoin,Prevention of Bladder infection,"""Macrodantin was prescribed to me to prevent UTI . I only have to take one when needed. During one month I got four fever attacks with chills, headaches and muscle cramps. Very much like flu symptoms . It goes on for 2 days then I am fine again.  Eventually I realised that it might be this medication since I took one on a Friday evening and the next day when I woke up I got this horrible symptoms again  I read about the side effects and realised that this might be the cause."""
Hydrochlorothiazide / losartan,High Blood Pressure,"""I have had high blood pressure for over a year and just started taking Hyzaar 2 days ago and already my blood pressure is 125/75.  This is at least 20 units drop in each number and I have not experienced any side effects yet. I feel a lot better."""
Candesartan,Migraine Prevention,"""I have suffered with migraines for the past 34 years. I had chronic acute migraines (18-27 per month). I have been on more preventive medications than I can count. My neurologist put me on candesartan because nothing else had worked. I started at 4 mg and now take 8mg. In the three months that I have been on candesartan, I have only had a handful of very treatable migraines. I feel like my life is in my control now and my migraines no longer control me."""
NuvaRing,Birth Control,"""This is my first month on Nuva Ring.  No side effects.  I felt great.  I guess I am one of the lucky ones. My mood swings have disappeared.  I haven&#039;t felt grumpy or grouchy the week before my cycle.  No weight gain for me."""
Implanon,Birth Control,"""I had Implanon implanted August 2009. It was great until April 2011. I started getting my period not once but twice a month. The second is short. The first is full blown. I am a wreck the week before I start with super sore breasts (felt like I was pregnant) and horrible mood swings. The bleeding is terrible. Plus very unpredictable."""
Copper,Birth Control,"""I got it inserted at age 24 (almost 2 years ago) and it hurt like hell. It is regularly suggested to women who&#039;ve had children already because they have to slightly open the cervix to insert it, and I have no kids, but it is worth it. It contains no hormones, which means less damage to your body, and the efficacy is about 99.9%. Lasts up to 12 years, or you can have it removed any time before that."""
Epiduo,Acne,"""Epiduo makes my skin more oily then it actually is, I&#039;m not getting dry flakey skin just terrible oily skin.Im still using it every night for the last 6 months but I do still get normal acne, so not much has changed."""
Montelukast,Asthma,"""It worked very well for asthma symptoms. Greatly reduced lung inflammation.  It takes quite a few weeks to reach max effectiveness.  But gave me joint aches, muscle aches and all over malaise. This is listed as an uncommon side effect so it may not affect most."""
Metaxalone,Muscle Spasm,"""Have taken only for two days but seems to have helped. Have a L4 L5 problem and after a recent flair up this was prescribed. Seems to have helped to speed recovery."""
Varenicline,Smoking Cessation,"""I had great results. Within a short time of taking them I had stopped smoking. Taking 2 tablets daily wasn&#039;t the best thing for me so my doctor recommended only taking one and that was prefect.  I only took them for about two months then stopped. I&#039;ve been smoke free for about 7 months and it&#039;s been the best thing ever. I also was and am able to around smokers without dying inside for a smoke."""
Butorphanol,Labor Pain,"""All I can say is that stadol is AMAZING! I felt like I was floating on clouds and when the pain did come back I didn&#039;t care.. I could feel the pain but it was like I was disconnected from it somehow? After I had my son I asked what they had given me cause I had never felt like that before with my other babies. So if they offer it to you take it....it works!!! I couldn&#039;t imagine how these people are able to function if they take it for migraines??"""
Lamotrigine,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have been on it for 3 months now and I still feel like it is helping. I am taking the generic. Overall I feel like I have settled into a middle range where before I had been in the depressed range, well below the normal. I have had a lot of ups (wedding, incredible family time) and downs (work stress, financial problems) the last month. I won&#039;t lie, there have been a few days when I end up back in bed feeling so depressed like I did earlier this year when I was at my lowest point ever. But... I have been able to get through the few tough days and bounce back to what I feel is my normal self. My husband helps me keep tabs on how I&#039;m acting, and I&#039;ve headed back up again, But I&#039;d rather be on the &quot;up&quot; end than back on the low end."""
Breo Ellipta,COPD,"""I have been on prednisone 21 years non stop for a still unknown lung condition. I have tried so many different meds, specialists, treatments, etc. No matter what I still coughed, wheezed, couldn&#039;t breathe. The best combo so far was 20-30mg prednisone daily and Advair 500/50. I have not been able to get off prednisone for 21 years. If I tried, I ended up in the hospital within 48hrs. My insurance quit covering Advair, so my dr prescribed Breo. I am now on day 7 of NO PREDNISONE! Seven days! I am ecstatic! 21 years of prednisone has wrecked havoc on my body, but I havent taken it in 7 days! And I even took my dog for a walk yesterday! I dont know how its working when nothing else has, but it is!"""
Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""Hey all, I just wanted to share my experience because I was so scared to get skyla at first because of all the negative reviews. I&#039;ve had mine for a week now. The insertion process is hard (be sure to take off work after) I had severe cramps for about 4 hours and then minor cramping the next day. Since then I have had basically no pain. Me and my boyfriend waited 5 days before having intercourse and there was no pain when we did (yay!) I still am spotting which is kind of annoying but overall, I&#039;m really happy with this."""
Tramadol,Back Pain,"""Only seems to last for 4 hours."""
Propranolol,mance Anxiety,"""Incredible results! I used 80 mg (40 mg about 1 h before and 40 mg 10 to 15 minutes before the presentation) since my weight is 85 kg. No more fear of public presentations, especially when a microphone was involved!!"""
Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,"""I am so glad just googled everyone else&#039;s comments, I took 2 tablets yday and was fine .. After breakfast this morning I can honestly say my body hasn&#039;t known such pain and ALL over! From my head to my toes, it&#039;s hot outside yet I&#039;m inside shaking with shivers and a hot water bottle. My head is pounding, I have a dry mouth, ifeel disorientated... I ache all over, my tummy hurts ...So I&#039;ve stopped taking it and Dr says to wait and see what happens before I take another antIB. 
I&#039;m glad I&#039;m not alone as I thought I was going to call 999! Although not glad anyone else has suffered like this. Awful awful drug and F all help from doctors really."""
Nexplanon,Birth Control,"""I just got it put in April 2015 and I am about to get it taking out because I stay tired. I always wanna sleep. I have mood swings all the time. I do not feel like myself. I&#039;m just starting to see my period and its January 2016. I&#039;m going with out any birth controls because none of them are good for me."""
Adipex-P,Obesity,"""I started the pill on 10/9/15 I was 172.2 at the doctors, I&#039;m a 24 year old female, 4&quot;11 tall, weighed myself today 10/29/15 and I&#039;m 11 pounds lighter! I&#039;m 161.3!  No cravings for sweets which I have/had a HORRIBLE sweet tooth, stopped eating fast food as much, cut it out more than half, can&#039;t wait to see more progress.

Will update next month!"""
Bupropion / naltrexone,Obesity,"""I&#039;m on the second week. I have lost 8 lbs but I am going to stop taking it. I can&#039;t deal with the nausea and feeling sick all the time. I had to leave work one day last week because the nausea just kept getting worse. I think this medicine works but for me the results don&#039;t outweigh the side effects."""
Junel Fe 1 / 20,Birth Control,"""I love this bc pill. I had a baby in 2014 due to the lack of being able to follow birthcontrol directions..ie taking the pill every single day. any way.opps. After the birth of my daughter I was on depo..I hated it. My sex drive was gone I was nauseated and dizzy all the time I went to my obgyn who then prescribed nuvaring again hated it it fell out, I couldn&#039;t use it during intercourse it hurt so bad, nope. I went back to the obgyn and discussed my options, I asked about the pill...we agreed. I have been on this medication for about 8 months and its working lol. I get nauseated for a day or so when I first start my new pack. no weight gain no babies...that is my goal. I get a three month supply for 12 dollars."""
Ketoconazole,Seborrheic Dermatitis,"""This is a wonderful medicine.  It worked really well on the most stubborn fungal infection I&#039;ve ever had. I had tried everything on the market and nothing would work until this.  I&#039;m not going to lie, this stuff burns like crazy.  You will scream and cry because it burns that bad for about 10 minutes. Stick with it and you will get rid of the infection.  After about the 4th day it quit burning when I used it - and finally, I got rid of the infection. It&#039;s expensive even with insurance but well worth the cost. They gave me a coupon to use and it brought the cost down to about $35."""
Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,"""This antibiotic makes me extremely sick to my stomach, caused blurred vision and makes me extremely irritable.  If you do take this medication please eat a lot of food before taking.  """
Diclofenac,Osteoarthritis,"""Started on Meloxicam 15mg and it did nothing. Was in so much pain in my knees that i called my Dr. and he prescribed Diclofenac sodium DM 75 mg twice a day. I have been on this med for 5 days now. It helped with the pain, but I don&#039;t know if I can deal with the side effects of muscle aches, irritability, weakness, fatigue,stomach issues.  It is seeming like the side effects are winning. I can not continue to take this medication. I will be contacting my Dr. and giving him the details and will need to try something else, does anyone have any suggestions on a different medication?"""
Mirena,Birth Control,"""I am on my 2nd Mirena. I am 36 yrs old, no kids and never want kids.  The insertion was very painful, but tolerable. I did tear up a little from the pain and I took deep breathes to help get thru it. I love the Mirena. I did not gain weight from it, however, I am a runner. No acne, no abdominal pain. I am spotting brown, but that&#039;s normal after insertion..for the 1st couple weeks. I did not get my period the first time around, so I am hoping the same this time. Not having a period for 5 years is amazing. This alone is worth the uncomfortable pain during insertion. Take 800mg of ibuprofen 1 hour before..it helps a little bit. But you still feel it...feels like the most painful cramping, you can ever imagine. Ugh. Ps. #never been in labor."""
Ledipasvir / sofosbuvir,Hepatitis C,"""I am 22 years old and I have had the virus since 2015 .I started Harvoni on February, after 2 months of taken the pill once a day, the virus was not detected but I continued with the 3rd month of medication  and   now I will do the final blood test .I am really hoping that I will be cured because I really want to put this behind me.  My symptoms are fatigue, nausea, headache ,muscles aches, tiredness  but I don&#039;t care because  the result was amazing .Don&#039;t be discouraged you never know how strong you are until you go through it so good luck everyone"""
Toradol,Postoperative Pain,"""I had rotator cuff and bone spur surgery a week ago. At first they gave me hydrocodone 750 and I was still in pain so they changed me to Toradol 10 mg and I still have no relief. I have been in unrelenting pain for 7 days and I can&#039;t believe no one can help me!"""
Liletta,Birth Control,"""34, no children. I hate hormones but finally gave in due to abnormal uterine bleeding and the hope Liletta would stop my periods. It releases a slightly lower dose of hormones than Mirena which is why I chose it. Had 4 lidocaine shots and insertion was still painful but not unbearable. I&#039;ve had it for 5 weeks nows, I bled heavy with clots and terrible cramps starting right after insertion for nearly 3 weeks. Then it lightened up to just bleeding during the day but I was still using 3-4 tampons a day. Now I&#039;m finally spotting, with no bleeding in the evening or overnight. I had horrific breast tenderness, moodiness, some bloating but no real weight gain. Also a bit of acne which is very annoying. If my periods stop/lighten I will keep it."""
Miconazole,Vaginal Yeast Infection,"""Didn&#039;t apply specified amount because I wanted to test it using a SMALL amount. Thank god I did a test run because 10 seconds after inserting the cream insane burning, itch sensation came along. I know burning and itching could be a possible side effect but didn&#039;t know it would be so debilitating.  Felt almost as bad as getting burned by a hot iron. I immediately ran to the kitchen and got a piece of ice. I put the ice at the opening to calm the sensation down. The ice made me a little numb. After washing myself down there in the bathroom with nothing but water, I actually felt OKAY. I suggest if you want to use it, then choose the Monistat on the 7 day regimen, it&#039;s less potent than the 1 day &amp; 3 day regimens. Staying away from that stuff."""
Olanzapine,Bipolar Disorde,"""Was on Zyprexa for a week 10mgs originally prescribed for sleep and coming off of Geodon. Gordon caused anxiety eventually. Zyprexa calmed me down but it was still hard to fall asleep without Ambien. I feel tired slow and hungry all the time the next day. But it did calm my nerves the next day so it may be worth it to give it a try."""
Citric acid / magnesium oxide / sodium picosulfate,Bowel Preparation,"""I had a colonoscopy today and used Prepopik for bowel preparation.  For my last colonoscopy several years ago, I had used Magnesium Citrate and found the Prepopik SO much easier to take, and my doctor said I had a nice, clean colon afterward.  The way I took it, I didn&#039;t taste it, and it went down very easily.  This is what I did:  Before drinking the Prepopik, I had a small amount of ginger ale.  I prepared the Prepopik with very cold water, and after stirring it as directed, I added a few ice cubes.  Using a straw and HOLDING MY NOSE, I sucked that baby right down in several big gulps, and following a recommendation I saw on the internet, I immediately sucked on a lemon!  Sounds weird, but it worked!!  I seriously didn&#039;t taste the stuff!"""
Liraglutide,Obesity,"""I haven&#039;t tried this medication even though my doctor suggested it. My insurance (bcbs) covers a portion. With the savings card - I would still owe over $1000 a month! Just curious how the company can justify charging this amount for a weight loss drug. At this price- I could afford weight loss surgery!!!! Disappointed """
Adderall,ADHD,"""This has worked very well for me. Am able to get things done without being all over the place, and actually feel great overall."""
Sertraline,Anxiety and Stress,"""I started using Zoloft one and a half years ago.  It definitely helped my mood, especially anxiety and depression.  I also have a much more stable mood throughout my day.  It did cause me to gain weight when I started taking it, but I was not eating enough prior to taking the medicine.  Occasionally, I would get headaches and after a while my body started having panic attacks again.  But for the first year at least, I would say it was the perfect medication"""
Saxenda,Weight Loss,"""Completed two weeks on Saxenda today and experienced an 18 pound weight loss. Began at 284lbs, now 266lbs. I&#039;m a 55yo male and 6&#039; tall. About to commence the 1.8 dose, experienced fatigue and nausea most days, hoping the side effects settle down over the next few weeks. Haven&#039;t felt hungry since taking the first dose, getting by quite well on two small meals per day, drinking plenty of water and mint tea. No cravings for anything, really pleasantly surprised the mind and body have finally aligned to make real weight loss a possibility. Taking shot at night just before bedtime to minimise exposure nausea, no so sure it&#039;s working. Would recommend highly to those who have previously unsuccessfully attempted dieting and exercise regimes."""
Doxepin,Insomnia,"""Got samples from my doctor last week and a script I have not filled. Used it three nights. Worked pretty good for me, will fill my script."""
Vyvanse,ADHD,"""I have a love/hate relationship with this medication. I was diagnosed with ADD in my late thirties. 
Vyvanse helps me a lot...when I can feel its effects. I take 50 mg a day. For three hours, I feel wonderful and very productive. The drug make feel very calm, hence very focused. I feel at peace and I stop questioning every single thing I do. It&#039;s like my usually racing thoughts (cognitive hyperactivity) stop for a moment and let me focus on the task at hand. 
BUT, when the drug wears off, after only three or four hours, I feel HORRIBLE! My throat gets tight, a disabling anxiety kicks in, I feel depressed, my thoughts start racing again and honestly, I feel like I could kill myself. So I go from feeling wonderful to being suicidal..."""
Dilaudid,Chronic Pain,"""In my opinion its a weakist. Pain Management drug out there. I would have to take 10 4mg to get the slightest relief  and that&#039;s on top of  wearing a 100mcg patch  fentanyl."""
Sronyx,Birth Control,"""I received Sronyx from a free clinic and I have been on it for over 3 years! I have literally tried every single birth control option they had available. Nothing has ever given me such perfect experiences as Sronyx has. While I&#039;m on Sronyx my periods are very light without cramps or pain. All my acne is gone and my skin glows! And if I miss a pill, like clockwork I would breakout. Sronyx even regulates my weight and curbs my appetite, no lie. I notice other birth controls make you extremely hungry and gain weight but Sronyx does no at all. I will never stray away from this pill. I absolutely love it!"""
Lithium,Bipolar Disorde,"""As long as I take  lithium capsules and NOT the tablets, I have no side effects.  Presently on 900 mg a day.  Doesn&#039;t make me sleepy as I have insomnia.  Tablet gave me a salty taste in my mouth.  I drink about one more 16.9 oz bottled water than normal.  Stabilized my moods tremendously, easy to take.  I take with a protein shake, almond milk, applesauce but not on an empty stomach or then it gives me a slight stomach ache."""
Liraglutide,Obesity,"""I started Saxenda August 2017 and in 3.5 months have lost 33lbs. My doctor and I are very happy with the results. Started at 202lbs and now am 169lb.

I have more energy and it feels better to work out/move because I am not carry as much weight around. Good luck to everyone- I hope to keep on loosing!"""

Mirtazapine,Depression,"""This medication has been a god-send for me. After 13 years of daily panic attacks which always got worse if I was tired or stressed... I have not had ONE since I started this medication.
If you can get passed the side effects this is a wonderful medication. For me - my side effects are an increase in appetite and subsequent weight gain, and brain zaps at night when I get really tired - but these are starting to get better... I am just about to start month 3.
The first 2 weeks were hell, as I was constantly exhausted and could not seem to wake up mentally until about noon and hit the best part of my day around 5 pm; and starving all the time. If you can make it through that  - it is totally worth it."""
Hydroxyzine,Anxiety,"""I had my first (and only so far) panic attack April 14,2014. I thought I was having a heart attack and had my husband take me to the E.R.  After EKG was cleared the doctor gave me 2 Xanax and told me I suffered from a panic attack. I have not been the same since. I have had anxiety, arm pain and jaw pain (from tension), heart palpitations, hot flashes etc. I saw my doctor and she set me up with Hydroxyzine and it has been a life saver. 25mg up to 4 times A day as needed. I sleep great and function mostly every day normally. Every now and then I have a bad day , but very far and few between. 100% recommended to everyone."""
Desvenlafaxine,Depression,"""I have been on Pristiq for about 3 months.  I had insane anxiety and depression as well as insomnia that got so bad I ended up in the ER. I don&#039;t care if I ever come off of Pristiq because it works. I am normal again. I sleep, and for about 2 months I almost forgot what it was like to feel so anxious I could hardly function at work or life.

Lamotrigine,Bipolar Disorde,"""It&#039;s so nice to be sane without side effects."""
Contrave,Weight Loss,"""I am on my second week of Contrave.  So far nothing. Zero. No help for my hunger/cravings whatsoever.  If anything I am eating more.  I lost weight on Phenfen but I can&#039;t sleep at all so I went off.

Fingers crossed."""
Benzoyl peroxide / clindamycin,Acne,"""ok I&#039;ve never posted a review but just had to for this stuff, it has changed my life!!! I put up with hormonal acne for years. I went to my dr and asked for acne medication but as I was going to be ttc again soon he didn&#039;t want to give me oral medication but gave me the duac cream to try... It lasts 2 months, and honestly it cleared my acne up within 3-4 weeks... I saw improvements straight away... I still got the odd pimple in that time but my biggest fear was that I would stop the cream and they would all come back. Well I used it for the full 2 months and I&#039;m sooooo happy to say I literally have not had another single pimple since I stopped using it and that was 2 months ago!! every time I feel my soft smooth face I just can&#039;t believe it"""

AndroGel,"Hypogonadism, Male","""I have been using Androgel for about 3-1/2 weeks now. 4 pumps a day( 5 grams), and I am finding no difference in mood, sex drive, libido, weight, or anything. I have been applying it as recommended, yet nothing. I do not know my numbers as of yet, as my Doctor prescribed this over the phone. I was hoping that this would help me turn the corner."""
Melatonin,Insomnia,"""I really like  my melatonin. It makes me sleep a lot better on its own. Even with just one pill , it helps make me a bit drowsy and I feel like I can get to sleep a bit more quickly. This one really doesn&#039;t carry over into the next day as much as some of my other ones for sleep.  The only thing is , it&#039;s really not as strong as I need. I have really intense insomnia. It does work though and the difference is noticeable. It tends to also melt pretty quickly but it&#039;s pretty flavorless , so , it&#039;s not that bad. I think for just someone who has occasional , minor insomnia , It&#039;s something that would work out."""
Linaclotide,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,"""I took Linzess earlier this year when I was constipated constantly from IBS and gastroparesis. It either gave me diarrhea or didn&#039;t work. Then my bowels normalized for a while so I quit taking it.
About two weeks ago, the constipation started again, so I began taking it again. This time it was wonderful. I haven&#039;t had diarrhea; instead, it gives me a regular bowel movement each day and I don&#039;t have to stay at my house for several hours after I take it to make sure I stay near a bathroom. I&#039;m on the higher dose of it. This is the way I had hoped it would work from the beginning."""
Ethinyl estradiol / norethindrone,Birth Control,"""I have done a month of this birth control, I am okay with taking the pill but something like a Nuvaring, or the Implanon would be easier for me. But this pill made me sick when I missed a day and took two so I took some Tylenol for my horrible headache (I believe that was also from Loestrin24). I haven&#039;t had any noticeable weight gain. I also have no other complaints other than the mood swings I had been throwing at my boyfriend and my family. My doctor switched me to Lo Loestrin because it is a lower dose. We will see how that goes and I&#039;ll make sure I leave a review with all that I try. Thanks for all the reviews I have read!"""

Lisinopril,High Blood Pressure,"""I took one pill and I have never been so sick in my life.  Diarrhea, vomiting, chest pain etc.  I think I had every side effect listed for this medicine.  It has taken me almost 24 hours with no food or drink to get over this."""

Some of the side effects I am having are weird vivid dreams, super increased libido and out of 6 of the 7 days I&#039;ve taken Viibryd, I&#039;ve awakened out of my sleep to very intense orgasms. Other than that I feel much better. The real test will be when my PDD occurs. If it can control my lows during my period then we have a winner."""
Atenolol,High Blood Pressure,"""I use atenolol as one of three medications now (along with Norvasc and Hydrochlorothiazide) and the combination is working well. Blood pressure ranges in the 130/80 range and lower. I need it this low since I am a diabetic."""

I would fall asleep and my boyfriend would wake me up and I didn&#039;t even know I was sleeping. 5 minutes later I would fall asleep again. It really sucked and I thought about removing it. I also had very irregular bleeding for maybe 5 months. I&#039;m glad I did not get this removed!!! All of those symptoms stopped after the first month (besides the bleeding). Now that I&#039;ve had it for over a year and a half, I never get a period, just occasional spotting every 3 or 4 months. Besides when first inserted, I haven&#039;t had any pain in my arm.

The other night I ate what was supposed to be a gluten free sandwich; the cook screwed up. I expected the usual rush to the bathroom, except it didn&#039;t come. This time I was so constipated my pants wouldn&#039;t fit. MOM has has helped a bit. It took about 20 minutes before I ran to the bathroom. However, it has made me more gassy than anything; I&#039;m scared to pass gas incase something else happens. My stomach and intestines sound like a warzone. It seems to help a bit, but has anyone else had the gas issue? Every time I go to the bathroom very little comes out, but it always follows a burst of gas."""
Nexplanon,Birth Control,"""I have had nexplanon since July of 2014. I am getting it removed tomorrow, and am going to see about getting permanent contraception. The first month after I got it I had no period, but became very irritable and short-tempered. After the first month I had my period constantly for almost 6 months. Then it became incredibly unpredictable. I started using a period tracker online, and noticed that my periods began getting more regular about 4 months ago. It was 2 weeks of bleeding, followed by 2 weeks of no bleeding.
Another reason I am getting it out is because of weight gain. I gained around 35 pounds over the 2 years I&#039;ve had it. My weight has been increasing steadily, and no amount of exercise or diet will help."""

I bleed heavy, cramp and have migraines for at least 10 days. It knocks me off my feet to where all I can do is stay in bed all day. I have to use double protection when on my period. I bleed so much the first month that I almost had my husband take me to the ER. I instead started taking iron pills to help me recover from my period. With all the scare on blood clots in the news I just called and asked my doctor to switch me to something else. The other thing was that I have zero sex drive and I can&#039;t lose weight."""
Phentermine / topiramate,Weight Loss,"""I started phentermine 05/13, by 07/13 the medication felt as if it had quit working. I become &quot;immune&quot; to medication.

I can eventually go back to the same meds, but only after they&#039;ve been switched up a bit first. 
My doctor upped my dosage to x2 a day. I got the script 09/01/13 &amp; joined the gym that same day. I&#039;ll take the phentermine for 3 weeks, then come off for 10 days. Start again for 3 weeks. I work out 5 days a week, for 1 1/2 hours. On 03/07/14 I had dropped 56lbs. No where near what I wanted. That same day, I started the Topamax. I&#039;ve not weighed yet but I feel a difference.

Side effects have been minimal, mild nausea the first few weeks. Very tired I&#039;ve noticed but it&#039;s all worth it.

I had one hip replaced 8 months ago and due for another soon. I took my dose this morning, 50mg every 8 hours and really weird feeling. Hoping it goes away because my husband said I was a lot more pleasant to be around yesterday. I was also put on Lyrica at bedtime. Could this be cause of spacey feeling?"""
Benzaclin,Acne,"""I&#039;ve been using this for about 3 years now. This is probably the first product I&#039;ve ever used that resulted in clearer skin, both on my face and my body. I went from having at least 5-7 big red pimples at all times, often more when I was on my period, to having clear skin with maybe a few small blemishes most of the time. It took a few months before I noticed it was actually working. Everything was great until 2 months ago, I now have acne just as bad, if not worse, than ever before (face and back). I still use Benzaclin but it&#039;s had absolutely no effect, which is extremely disappointing. Back to square one I guess."""
Duac,Acne,"""This really works. I used it for a week and my acne cleared but I found out using a bit to much will dry your face up and itch badly, but worth it, well for me. I was also given DIFFERIN with it, makes a good combination."""
Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,"""I have had hyperhidrosis since the 6th or 7th grade and it really is one of the worst things that you can have when you are trying to have a social life. I started hypercare 3 days ago and it works like magic. Like many others was stuck to wearing black and white Ts and tank tops. Not anymore. The first day I got it I wore grey. Not a sweat mark at all. The only downside is that the pain of it is horrible, because it burns so bad. I&#039;m only on my third day and I hope that it starts to lessen soon but other than that, it truly is a blessing."""
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""I got the Implanon a month ago and have felt kind of weird. I&#039;ve been on my period for two weeks pretty heavily.

Venlafaxine,Depression,"""I just started a few weeks ago and it has helped stabilize my mood, give me energy. Not noticing any major side effects.  I&#039;ve had some headaches, some light nausea and some crazy dreams. But I&#039;ve always had crazy dreams. Other medications gave me much worse side effects. Effexor seems to be working for me. My daughter says that I&#039;m &quot;funny&quot; again.  I love that!"""
Belviq,Weight Loss,"""I started Belviq after first losing a significant amount on Weight Watchers, so progress was sort of slow for me. I lost about a half a pound a week for the three months I was on it, but my motivation level was low. The problem for me came when I tried to stop taking it.  I had the symptoms of antidepressant discontinuation syndrome pretty bad. These included lightheadedness, dizziness, tingly hands and feet, and blurry vision. This all scared me very much - I thought I was going to have a stroke. I even had what felt like an electric shock shoot through different parts of my body a few times.  I was really relieved to find out that this is a fairly common condition and only lasts 2-3 weeks, but it was pretty uncomfortable."""
Tranylcypromine,Depression,"""My experience of tranylcypromine [Parnate] was very positive from the beginning. The first time I was administered 20mg I felt suddenly much better than I had for weeks. I wanted to go outside and &#039;see the world&#039;. So far so good.  Now comes the Kick In The Head.  In the UK  30mg is the highest that they can prescribe. However I tried up to 60mg and it has been beneficial and I have come across blogs and psychiatric accounts on the web that suggest that this dose is ok in the USA That would never happen here in the UK. The guidelines stop at 30mg per day which is unacceptable in the UK especially since the price was increased to &pound;25.00 per 28 tablets.  I have had pressure applied from my GP to stop using this drug."""
Ethinyl estradiol / levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""This is the only birth control that I&#039;ve tried, but so far I&#039;ve been tolerating it fine. I&#039;m almost finished my second pack and I haven&#039;t experienced any spotting or mood swings that anyone else has mentioned. My acne has gotten worse though...I usually only get one or two pimples, but now I have acne around my hairline, my nose, chin and chest. I&#039;m going to stick it out for a few more months to see how it goes; I&#039;ve been using 5% benzoyl peroxide cream to help with the acne problem. 

I noticed that I had next to no cramping and my period was only 4 days, when it usually lasted a week before.

Overall I&#039;m pleased with this birth control, but if the acne persists I may try switching."""
Belviq,Obesity,"""I started Belviq on Thursday evening before dinner and today is Sunday morning.  I weighed in at 327-328 on Thursday and this morning was 324. I felt the affects instantly. I was shocked how sick I felt after trying to eat a regular size serving. I&#039;ve had almost half the usual amount of food at EVERY single meal since I started.  And almost zero between meal snacks. (I did have about 7 fresh cherries yesterday, but that&#039;s been the only snack).   No side effects - maybe a little dry mouth. I&#039;m not expecting to continue seeing this level of weight loss continue - but I&#039;m so optimistic about my future now. I love how tiny the pills are and I got a certificate from the Belviq website that makes it possible for me to only pay $75. It&#039;s  worth it"""
Adderall XR,ADHD,"""Diagnosed 3yrs ago, participated in Strattera study, did not help at all. Finally started Adderall 20mg XR two days ago. Main difference is the absence of fatigue and quieted mind. I can actually sit and not have to argue with myself, overwhelming feelings gone for the most part. Insomnia straight away first night, hardly any sleep again last (2nd) night, underlying headache now. Definite loss of appetite, appreciate the lost lbs but still have to eat!"""

Skyla,Birth Control,"""I got Skyla in December 2014 and so far have had a great experience. I am an extremely busy 20 year-old college student, with previous negative experiences with the Pill, and Skyla has been perfect. The insertion was quite painful and I had cramps for a few days and then spotting for about a month afterwards, but since then my periods have been getting lighter and seemingly a bit farther apart. My partner is a bit of a worrier so having something that&#039;s close to 100% effective has been a real load off his mind, and since we both got tested we don&#039;t have to use condoms anymore. ;) Not having to worry about birth control anymore has been fantastic. I would recommend Skyla to anyone looking for a low-maintenance form of birth control."""
Xyrem,Narcolepsy,"""I suffered from narcolepsy due to spending too much time in the REM sleep stage.  Xyrem regulates my sleep architecture, and now I no longer suffer from excessive daytime sleepiness."""
Xarelto,"Pulmonary Embolism, Recurrent Event","""Developed a serious DVT blood clot in the arm that broke loose into a small PE in my left lung.  I spent 3 months on Xarelto (3 weeks at 15 mg/twice a day and then 20 mg/once a day).  Completely recovered from PE and arm clot during that time and felt great (no side effects from Xarelto at all!).  3 weeks after quitting Xarelto, I developed a massive bi-lateral PE and found out I have Anti-Phospholipid Syndrome.  I&#039;m now back on Xarelto (and will be on thinners for life) for a little over a month.  The PE has cleared up and I&#039;ve returned to hiking.  No side effects/symptoms at all from the Xarelto.  Despite a few bumps and scrapes while hiking, I don&#039;t even have abnormal bleeding/bruising!  I&#039;m guessing this is due to it&#039;s short half life."""
Yasmin,Acne,"""I&#039;ve had acne my entire life tried everything from roaccutane to special diets to expensive creams and nothing worked. Started Yasmin and my skin became absolutely flawless. I wanted a kid, so I stopped the pill and my acne came back instantly. My son is now 5 months and I&#039;ve started Yasmin again because I need my acne to be gone! I&#039;m 29 and it&#039;s annoying to have skin his bad. This pill makes me crazy, but I&#039;ll take the craziness for clear skin. My sex drive disappeared while I was on it too. Lost weight which was a plus."""
Ethinyl estradiol / norethindrone,Acne,"""Most people that are complaining that they got acne using it are most most likely in their first/second month of using it. I&#039;m almost at my fifth month of taking Microgestin and I rarely break out now. I&#039;ve definitely been noticing that my skin looks better. Also, I have been weighing myself and have not gained weight from it. My advice is, just keep on taking it because most symptoms (mainly the acne part) gets worse before it gets better."""
Voltaren Gel,Pain,"""My muscles in my shoulder get really tense because of a pinched nerve in my neck and I also have osteoarthritis and lower back pain this stuff when I have a flare up this stuff works wonders.

Do not take yourself off this drug &quot;cold turkey&quot;.  Caused many psychotic episodes for me which disappeared when returning to the drug.  Sad movies no longer make me cry. Don&#039;t have great joyful moments either.  I don&#039;t stagger around like when I was on lithium.  I do have hypertension not always controlled by the 3 antihypertensive I&#039;m taking."""
Cymbalta,Depression,"""Cymbalta 120mg for 4 months
Good:
- slight to moderate increase in motivation, mental energy and attention/alertness.
- decrease in anxiety and depressive feelings.
Bad:
- made me less social, less empathetic and more robotic.
- horrible withdrawal symptoms which happen quickly if you forget to take it.
- when my dosage was increased from 30mg to 60mg, it started to give me nightmares at night and caused me to wake up in middle of the night and lose sleep.

Conclusion: Better positive cognitive experience than 10mg Escitalopram which other than positively affecting my mood, all it did was cause constant brain fogs and decrease my motivation even further."""
Ethinyl estradiol / etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""I was on it for 6 months with few side effects (vaginal discharge and itchiness, mild nausea and the occasional dizzy spell. Also, after sex the semen would just sort of leak out.) But those were mild issues compared to the mood changes that started in month 7. I noticed that little things would bother me and I was angry a lot. I was thinking it couldn&#039;t be the birth control because I have been on it for 6 months but I tried taking it out anyway and sure enough after a day, I feel happy again! No more anger. It was effective for preventing pregnancy %100. So talk to your doctor and see which BC works for you. Everyone is different so it may not cause any mood changes or side effects for you."""
Cyproheptadine,Migraine,"""I have been taking this for around three years now and I found that for the first year I was headache free. On my second year I was occasionally getting heads like 2 or 3 a month. Then after my third year of being on the medicine it seemed as though I was taking nothing to help with migranes. I have now been getting up 10 migranes at different times per day. I went to see my neurologist and he said I&#039;m having uncontrolled migranes and he put me on Topamax so I guess I will see how that goes."""
Sronyx,Birth Control,"""At first I thought I loved this pill, the problem with it crept in so subtly I didn&#039;t notice it (very similar to a previous complaint on saw on here). I&#039;ve never had issues with anxiety or depression before taking this. About 7 months into taking the pill my anxiety sky rocketed and I became increasingly depressed. Insomnia also became a consistent problem and I seriously thought I was losing my mind. My relationship with my husband also suffered from these serious side effects as I became extremely moody and would cry for no reason and not understand why.  My advice would be to seriously monitor how you feel while on this pill and note any changes in mood - becomes it definitely creeps in slowly."""
Bupropion / naltrexone,Obesity,"""Naltrexone alone can cause nausea. Wellbutrin alone causes nausea and in some cases permanent ringing in the ears.  I highly recommend everyone listen to your body. Nausea is the body&#039;s natural reaction to try to rid itself of something bad (viruses, foods, drugs) whatever it may be. This drug is NOT the answer.  Sure you will lose weight, but at what expense....nausea, ringing in the ears, vertigo and dependence on the drug which is very expensive?"""
Latuda,Bipolar Disorde,"""I was on 20 mg Latuda with 300 mg Lithium. It was the most normal I have felt in a while. For me it has being weight neutral in comparison with Zyprexa. Zyprexa made me gain 5 pounds per day &amp; 80 pounds in a few days. Latuda gave me more energy to work out. Naturally, if I don&#039;t take meds I don&#039;t even have to work out &amp; have a fast metabolism &amp; loose weight easily. With meds I need to exercise. However, the main difference is that with Zyprexa I would exercise 5 times per week, 2 hours per day, eat healthy &amp; still gain a ton of weight. Latuda helps me maintain healthy weight. Unfortunately, my doctor for some reason decided to increase my Latuda doze to 40 mg. I am now having muscle spasm, around my eyes."""
Venlafaxine,Depression,"""I started this medication about 4 months ago after being on Prozac for 5 months. Antidepressants react differently for everyone, and I am happy to say I have had a very good experience with this medication thus far. I have much more energy, will to live, and my anxiety has also decreased immensely. I have not experienced any side effects with this, however I strongly recommend staying away from alcohol. After a night of drinking I would fall into a depressive state or have a panic attack. This never happened to me before taking this medication."""
Sronyx,Birth Control,"""Well I&#039;ve just started my first pack of it and I&#039;m on the sugar pills now but about 1 week ago, I had sex without a condom so we&#039;ll see how that goes."""
Ziana,Acne,"""great product! Before trying this I used so many over the counter products, but this left me super clear, I had moderate to severe acne, today I get compliments on my skin almost daily! Try it and it may cause more breakouts in the beginning but its definitely worth the wait. I never write reviews but if this can inspire someone to continue finding a solution to their acne It would leave me feeling more than great. I used to cry daily about it and understand how self torturing it can be. Besides using this product, I also wanted to say I do not eat red meat and try to stay on a strict diet, with no dairy, and gluten free foods. I do eat chicken, fish, etc. I believe this has also impacted my skin greatly. There&#039;s hope trust me I know it&#039;s annoying but with persistence anything is possible!"""
Valsartan,High Blood Pressure,"""Was on Tekturna for many years. Switched to Valsartan because my numbers were creeping up. Used to cough on Tekturna a lot. No more. I&#039;m 116/65 now and my wife is also very pleased with the fact that there are no negative side effects that would impact her enjoyment of life."""
Enzalutamide,Prostate Cance,"""Side effects are too harsh and sickening."""
Diazepam,Anxiety,"""Was originally prescribed as a shortcourse to take 2 or 3 daily to get through a really bad patch but I have found it works better to only take occasionally when I really need it. 
Provides pretty fast (within 15 mins to half hour) yet lasting (up to 3/4 hours) relief of Anxiety. Works a treat it&#039;s probably the best thing i&#039;ve ever taken for Anxiety. The only criticism is it can make you feel a bit out of it and slow but it depends on the dose. I was prescribed 5mg tablets and i find that snapping them in half to have 2.5mg still works but makes me less drowsy. I adjust the dose depending on how severe the Anxiety is. 
It&#039;s a good idea to experiment when first prescribed so you know how it affects you."""
Palbociclib,"Breast Cancer, Metastatic","""Initial breast cancer stage 2 in 2001 with chemo and radiation. Diagnosed stage 4 with mets to one rib in October 2015. One year on zometa with letrozole and ibrance for nearly two years. No serious side effects and my tumor marker went from 220 to 83. No trouble with blood cell counts. Some tiredness and nausea. Small meals and lots of water help. Ibrance is now covered by Medicaid. With this leadership in charge, who knows what will happen to me. I can&#039;t afford it on income of $2,000 a month. Eek."""
Chateal,Birth Control,"""Previously, I was on a microgestin pill from Planned Parenthood, but I wanted a pill that would let me have my periods so they switched me to Chateal. It was a bit more potent than the one I was previously on but I really did not experience any worse side effects. I experienced moderate weight gain - I am already pretty petite though so this did not bother me. The only time I experience any mood problems is the few days preceding my period. The pack that I have has the 4th row of reminder/sugar pills, and I usually do not start bleeding until my 3rd or 4th day in, and the periods are light and very manageable. All in all I have had a great experience, however my transition from microgestin pills to Chatel may have played a leading role."""
Mysoline,Seizures,"""I have been taking this medication for 30 years, and have never had a side effect or seizure. Works very well for me. No complaints. """
Levonorgestrel,Emergency Contraception,"""I had sex with a condom, he took it off in between, and then put on another one. Ultimately, he came into the condom, but I was worried about precum. I think it was also the time I was ovulating. I took plan b one step 26 hours after and I&#039;m 160 lbs. I got my period around two weeks later and have an irregular cycle. It was spotting for for like 5 hours that morning/afternoon and then I got my period normally that night. It lasted about 6 days, as usual. The only symptoms I felt were nausea for one day a few days after I took the pill, bloating, and really bad acne. My face has breakouts all over it and it&#039;s been almost 2 months. I just got my second period since the pill now that it is March, so it surely worked. bad acne though."""
Plan B One-Step,Emergency Contraception,"""We had sex Day 9 of cycle. He didn&#039;t pull out-Took Plan B onestep within 2hrs. No side effects.
Day 31 of cycle-Took clear blue easy- NOT PREGNANT (23 days after sex)
Im age 48,sexually active, irregular periods that can be 20 -50 days apart(perimenopausal) may not be ovulating every month.  I could say the pill worked by delaying ovulation, which on regular 28 day person could have happened between day 12-14.  On the flip side, odds of it being due to pill working could be 50/50. I&#039;m healthy, sometimes not ovulating, he is 50, plus uses medical marijuana-3strikes already-odds of conception is lowered. We used pull out method for over 10 years- didn&#039;t want to take small chance-happy to have option of Plan B!"""
Zipsor,Pain,"""This product didn&#039;t work for me.  The risks did not outweigh the side effects.  I used it after my colonoscopy and had to use other pain medicines as well."""

Levofloxacin,Prostatitis,"""I was given a month supply and after 2 days the side effects are to great I just can&#039;t take it anymore.  I wake up in the middle of night to use restroom and will be so dizzy I feel like I will be about to faint.  I&#039;ll sit down to use restroom and my arms and hands start to tingle.  My calves are also VERY sore.  I&#039;m not allergic to any other medication that I know of either.  Doctor is calling in a different medicine tomorrow."""
Myrbetriq,Overactive Bladde,"""I&#039;m 20 years old and have had issues with my bladder for about a year now. This is the first medication I&#039;ve taken and it has done nothing for me.

Ciprofloxacin,Prostatitis,"""I took this medicine for 2 months straight. The condition fluctuated, but for the  most part improved. After 2 months I stopped taking it and symptoms returned.  """
Mirapex,Restless Legs Syndrome,"""I have had RLS for years. I dealt with it for a long while until it started doing it during the day and started creeping into my arms. Got put on Mirapex to attempt to control it. It was the most awful thing I&#039;ve ever taken. Lost huge chunks of memory, couldn&#039;t keep up with conversations, hallucinations, and major insomnia. I couldn&#039;t sleep before but to be given a &quot;wonder drug&quot; and have it exacerbate the situation was beyond bearable. No thanks."""
Verapamil,Migraine Prevention,"""I have suffered with severe migraines since 2008 and had been on so many different medications to try to control them, with many either not working or causing horrible side effects. In 2013 my neurologist finally put me on Verapamil Hydrochloride 240mg and these worked for a while but I actually found that I was still getting migraines and eye pain, So we cut it down to 120mg and 50mg of armitriplyline and again I found the pain was still there. I then stopped taking the amitriptyline and only took verapamil 120mg. I have not looked back since as verapamil has been amazing and haven&#039;t had a migraine at all (unless I forget to take my tablet) Obviously it is different for everyone, But this has been my God send!"""
Ethinyl estradiol / norgestimate,Ovarian Cysts,"""I had two large ovarian cysts that were extremely painful and put me in the ER. My Dr. Prescribed me Mononessa and I just finished my first pack. I had an ultrasound today and one cyst was completely gone and the other is much smaller. After only 3 weeks on this pill I haven&#039;t experienced the pain from my cysts anymore. The only thing is that for the first week on the pill I was extremely nauseous. It also seems that as of right now my acne is almost completely gone."""

Benicar,High Blood Pressure,"""It made feel like I was drunk all the time the unsteadiness on my feet blurred vision. It also gave me hives.

I hope this helps anyone thinking about taking it. My mother also worked with a women that took it for about a month and it made her pass out at work one day and she quit taking it too. Hope this helps!!!"""
Valtrex,"Herpes Simplex, Suppression","""I was introduced to Valtrex for HSV2 suppression in mid 2000 after surgery to my groin.  The outbreak was the worst I had experienced in the 20 years that I&#039;d suffered.  The daily 500mg treatment worked immediately in clearing up the outbreak, and much more importantly, I&#039;ve been OUTBREK FREE since then to the posting of this note, July 2011.  I&#039;m a believer.  Now the VA has changed my prescription of Valtrex, once a day, to Acyclovir, 400mg twice a day.

Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,"""I have been dealing with IBS-D since I was about 13  years old - I am now 25. The uncontrollable cramping and diarrhea gave me no quality of life. I wouldn&#039;t leave my house or do anything. What kind of life is that for a young adult?  Back in December 2015 my doctor told me about viberzi. This has been a GOD SEND medicine. I have my life back!! The second week I started taking it though, I woke up in excruciating pain. I went to the ER and I had a spasm of the sphincter of oddi. I stopped viberzi for a few days, then went on the 75mg and I take it once a day. I FINALLY can live a normal life and not worry every 5 seconds about where the bathroom is."""
Lexapro,Anxiety,"""I was prescribed lexapro about a year after my assault. I took only one pill. It made me feel worse than the anxiety it self.

Plan B,Emergency Contraception,"""I have taken plan b multiple times and for the most part it worked. However the last time I took it I started what I thought was my period and went to go have a surgery. They tested me and found out I was pregnant.

Tioconazole,Vaginal Yeast Infection,"""After inserting the one day capsule (that supposedly stays in place-NOT) I experience horrible itching! I&#039;ve used it several times before, every time I get an infection and it does indeed work. I just experience an awful inch and burn, worse than my symptoms before the medicine. It&#039;s an unbearable itch, just be warned that it hurts but the medicine works!"""
Hydroxyzine,Allergic Urticaria,"""My Dr prescribed Hydroxyzine for my allergic reaction to dust mites and hives and began taking them at night. Best sleep I had in years but it actually increased my hives. It took me a month to figure out it was

Montelukast,Asthma,"""I have taken Singulair or the generic Montelukast for almost 2 decades now and have had excellent results on the drug. I almost cannot tell I have asthma while taking the medication, provided I am not exposed to cigarette, wildfire, or any other form of smoke.  However, I want to share that I have had the experience now of taking three U.S. generics that I did not have excellent results on.  Within about 30 days of starting the generic in each case, I began experiencing asthma symptoms as if I were taking either a placebo or nothing at all.  Only one generic that I have found thus far has been as effective for me as the brand name medication, and the generic has unfortunately been discontinued by my pharmacy."""
Vyvanse,Binge Eating Disorde,"""I have suffered silently for about 35 years with Binge eating disorder (BED).  My weight has gone up and down but in 2015 I lost 45 lbs.(was having health issues) to reach my current weight of 130.  But I struggled to keep it off.  At the same time I was having difficulty concentrating and completing tasks.  My Dr. thought I had ADD and prescribed vyvanse.  It helped with those symptoms BUT the real surprise came when I no longer was obsessed with food.  I didn&#039;t even know it was prescribed for BED!  It is  life changing for me.  A miracle really.  I even sleep better at night.  I had few episodes of a panicked feeling initially but they have gone away.  I feel normal now and my only fear is that someday it will be taken off the market."""
Pennsaid,Osteoarthritis,"""better than pain pills works the best and goes right to the pain"""
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""My son was born 4 1/2 months ago and my mother suggested I get the Nexplanon. I agreed because no period and 3 years of protection sounded great. None explained to me that I would bleed for several months before the period stopped. I&#039;m on day 42 of my period with all the symptoms. On top of that, my arm constantly aches where the implant is especially if I hold too much weight. Though I would get this again since it prevents pregnancy long term with one application, people should know exactly what to expect."""
Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,"""This medication was prescribed to me for a bladder infection. After I took the second dose I woke in the middle of the night with the worst headache I&#039;ve ever had in my whole life! I literally thought I might have to go into see the doctor. After it subsided I read all the reviews I could about this medication and it side effects.  It seemed as though it was starting to work for my bladder infection but the terrible side effects were not worth it. I called my doctor and they prescribed Cipro instead. It took care of my infection with no side effects."""
Aviane,2</span> users found this comment helpful.,"""I&#039;m going to start with the inactive pills tomorrow. I must say that the first week I used Aviane, my face and shoulders broke out terribly. But by the time I reached the middle of 2nd week, the breakouts started to calm down. I still do have pimples right now and discoloration from the breakout it gave me, but my skin is getting better. I noticed that my shoulders aren&#039;t breaking out anymore. I&#039;m experiencing a loss of appetite so I think that&#039;s whats making me lose weight. Also, I tend to have &quot;gag moments&quot;. I know it&#039;s kind of weird. I think my boobs got a little big too. I guess my body is still adjusting to the hormones I&#039;m putting in so I&#039;m just going to be patient about it."""
Effexor XR,Generalized Anxiety Disorde,"""It really does work. Made me feel mentally sharp again. I was previously always anxious but Effexor completely stopped my anxiety.

Ethinyl estradiol / norelgestromin,Birth Control,"""I&#039;m on my third week and cannot wait to get my period and go back to pills. The first week I was nauseous, but that went away. For all weeks I&#039;ve been anxious, paranoid, emotional, unable to sleep through the night, and broken out. My breasts have increased a full size, and were incredibly sore the first two weeks. The breakout started on my forehead but now, during week three, has taken over my arms! My chest and back are also broken out. So disappointed that the patch did not clear my skin like Loryna pills, it has only made my skin worse. The estrogen must be too high of a dosage for me."""

Amazing, I will be sticking with them. They also encourage me to make sensible choices in my diet. The only side effects I&#039;ve had other than the upset tummy&rsquo;s are burping a lot and loss of appetite, both of which I can live with."""
Butrans,Chronic Pain,"""I have used the Butrans patch for several years and paid a premium price at CVS.   Wal Green&#039;s has a generic patch and it cost more than half the price!
If you a cortisone nose spray on your skin before the patch is applied it will not give you an allergic reaction to the adhesive.    I have had stomach problems with the NSAIDs and the patch is great!
I don&#039;t think I could work if it wasn&#039;t for the patch,
FYI:    Everyone reacts differently to meds, so don&#039;t not try it.
It works great for me.  So I have nothing negative to say about this patch.   My insurance covers the generic brand.
$264 verses $750 brand name"""
Enbrel,Psoriatic Arthritis,"""I didn&#039;t want to take enbrel when my dr. first suggested it but I did take it and am very glad I did.  It has made a big difference in my life.

I don&#039;t even mind the injections any more but I know that I will feel better because of it."""
Aripiprazole,Depression,"""I was really hesitant to take Abilify after being on Zoloft and later Wellbutrin without noticing effects, but I did anyways and within a few days I started noticing effects. I feel surprisingly good now. I find myself doing chores like washing dishes or my laundry and realize that usually I would just slump around saying &quot;I&#039;ll do it tomorrow&quot; until I&#039;m nearly out of clean clothes or dishes. I find myself singing to songs on the radio and my mood is not only noticeably better -- but remarkably and incredibly better. 

I haven&#039;t noticed any side effects except maybe that I&#039;m a bit hungrier than usual -- for instance, I&#039;ll feel hungry and get a meal but not be able to finish it. So far, excellent results. Only about 2 weeks in."""
Doxylamine,Insomnia,"""I only need a quarter of a tablet to get to sleep and stay there for about five hours. I do not want to &quot;get used to it&quot; so I also try not to used it too often.

Liraglutide,Obesity,"""Started April 1.  I have now completed 3 months and weight 213 lbs.  I started drug at 238 and my all-time high was 249.  I am very pleased with the weight loss of 25 lbs. and 36 respectively. I am so happy I started this drug because I am tired of being fat. It is so nice to look in the mirror and like what you see. Once I reach my goal weight of about 190, I will probably stop the drug and swim all by himself. I will never again allow myself to get fat again and will keep on eating properly. As long as you stay away from the deadly foods like soda,cake, cookies, pies, ice cream, red meat and fried foods, you are good to go!  Just add in water, portion-control, treadmill, and some help from above and you will be alright! No side effects."""
Zoloft,Social Anxiety Disorde,"""Zoloft got rid of my anxiety (I have general anxiety) at 50 mg. At 75 Mg, my tics started improving greatly (lessening). Unfortunately though, Zoloft made me more depressed, in an apathetic way. I suspect it&#039;s the decrease in dopamine due to raising my serotonin. Dr is adding Wellbutrin. Maybe I&#039;ll get my sex drive back too (which Zoloft also squashed). Overall, for Anxiety, it works very well for me."""
Bupropion,"Sexual Dysfunction, SSRI Induced","""I have tried several anti-depressants and this is the only one that has not taken away my libido or inability to reach orgasm. No libido can cause depression, the whole point of taking these medications.

Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,"""I&#039;ve been on this pill for about a month and I love it. No mood swings and same sex drive. The only noticable difference is my breasts! They are so tender. They feel as if I have a 90 pound clip hanging on my nipples. I do get nauseous through out the day but its bearable. My weight is the same. Sometimes I have an appetite, other times I don&#039;t. Overall, this is a great birth control."""
Nexplanon,Birth Control,"""I am 17 years old, sexually active and was first on the normal birth control pill but my doctor suggested me to get nexplanon /implanon.

It does wonders for some but didn&#039;t for me."""
Citalopram,Anxiety and Stress,"""First 2 days were euphoric and nothing could upset me. Then got more irritable and anxious. Stomach in knots.

Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""I have had Mirena since December. Initially there was some discomfort for the first week or so but since then I haven&#039;t noticed it once. My boyfriend has felt the string a couple times but nothing major. 95% of the time we have sex he doesn&#039;t notice it and neither do I. What I like best about it, besides not having to take the pill everyday, is that I only have my period every other month if that. I definitely would recommend it if you hate taking the pill and aren&#039;t thinking about having kids anytime soon. Luckily my Mirena was free through the local health center. Definitely worth it!"""

I&#039;ve had small bumps on my forehead that had been going away but now I have an even bigger problem. My face looks broken out all over. I&#039;ve read the reviews &amp; they say give it sometime to work &amp; adjust but I don&#039;t know if my self-confidence can handle it but I&#039;ll see what happens in the next few weeks with it.

Tioconazole,Vaginal Yeast Infection,"""Cleared everything up but felt like I was being stung by bees for almost 2 hours!!!! But worth it!"""
Citalopram,Anxiety and Stress,"""I have switched from Zoloft to Celexa because Zoloft wasn&#039;t working for me like it used to.  I have been on the Celexa for only about a week but I am experiencing stomach pain.  I am irritable, moody, and have even surprised myself with suicidal thoughts which I have never had before.  This medication is so not for me, however, everyone&#039;s experience is different because our bodies are so different."""
Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,"""I took a dose, felt weird and went to sleep. Took my second dose twelve hrs later and feel so weird. My left eye hurts, my neck hurts. I will not take another dose of this. I am terrified of the side effects  I am having from this. Anyone who is considering should think again. Although some people may have a good experience, you never know."""
Sodium oxybate,Narcolepsy,"""I&#039;m still in the early stages of taking XYREM (week 6), but it has changed my life. I almost never take naps, and have had my narcoleptic episodes significantly reduced.  I get around 8 hours of sleep every night, and can stay awake with no issues all day. Sometimes in the morning I feel a little groggy, but can&#039;t get back to sleep which i&#039;m sure is just the medicine wearing off as it goes away shortly after I get up and about."""
Bisacodyl,Constipation,"""This medicine always does what it is supposed to do. My only problem is that it causes severe cramps. """
Doxylamine / pyridoxine,Nausea/Vomiting of Pregnancy,"""I have all day sickness. I started taking it around 9 weeks, after 24 hrs of straight vomiting, and when I woke the next day, I was able to keep something down. Initially, I was sleepy, but I started taking 1 pill every 6-8 hrs and I usually have no sleepiness issues and I&#039;m able to eat throughout the day. I&#039;m 16 weeks and still on it because without it, I still have times/days where I feel sick. When I forget to take a dose is when it doesn&#039;t work - I think each person will need to figure out the best times to take it."""
Finasteride,Androgenetic Alopecia,"""I have taken finasteride for 20 months, and rogaine 9 months (last 9 months).  I lost hair initially during the shedding phase which i never got back.  Now I have not lost anymore hair but I did not experience any regrowth.  No effect on erection.  

On another note, I reduced my alcohol intake by 80% (now have 3-5 drinks per week in total) and have increased libido."""
Duloxetine,Depression,"""I took my first dose of generic Cymbalta last night of 60 milligrams. It&#039;s now 5:47 PM &amp; I&#039;ve not eaten all day due to the severe nausea. I&#039;m also very jittery, anxious, have a super, really bad headache (I&#039;m also prone to migraines.), &amp; my tinnitus is worse in my left ear. I also have slept most of the day, besides. I have depression &amp; mild PTSD &amp; anxiety &amp; migraines, I&#039;ve been on other anti-depressants before. Prozac increased my migraines the last time. I think this generic of Cymbalta won&#039;t be for me."""
Levonorgestrel,Emergency Contraception,"""I love this pill. After unprotected sex, the next morning I called Walmart&#039;s pharmacy to ask if they had any Plan B One Step in stock she said they did so I went down there and bought it. I took it exactly 9 hours afterwards."""
Effexor,Depression,"""Effexor was the first medicine given to me when I started having panic attacks. It helped me with my depression and stopped the crying spells. But I still continued to have panic attacks."""
Aviane,Birth Control,"""This birth control has been the best for me.  I know that there are many mixed reviews about it, but it has never given me any trouble at all.  I have also tried Lo Loestrin Fe, Trinessa (HORRIBLE vaginal irritation) and Ortho-Tri Cyclen which all gave me various side effects.  It just goes to show that everyone&#039;s bodies respond differently to different medicines.  This birth control cleared up my acne, increased my cup size, and regulated my period.  The only issue that I could complain of would be slight mood swings from time to time, but honestly that&#039;s it for me.  I would highly suggest giving this birth control a try!"""
Solifenacin,Overactive Bladde,"""VESIcare did nothing for me."""
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""I got Implanon about 2 to 3 years ago and it was the worst thing I&#039;ve ever experienced. I had it in for a little over six months and I bled the entire time, I cramped, I got migraines, so I took it out. So now I have nexplanon and it&#039;s been about 2 months. I bled for two or three weeks and then I haven&#039;t gotten my period since I actually feel a lot better. The first time with Implanon my head felt fuzzy and it was hard to concentrate but not with nexplanon. I think the experience depends on your age and your hormone levels and if you had a break for a baby or not. I would have to say I like both better then the pill or patch."""
Vraylar,Schizophrenia,"""I have schizoaffective disorder bipolar type this medicine is a wonder drug it has helped with seeing things and voices. Its also helped with the negative symptoms of schizophrenia too. Now for my bipolar its helped stabalize my moods and i am nowhere near depressessed anymore.I have had no side effects at all as well my weight has been the same without diet and exercise too"""
Rizatriptan,Migraine,"""This is the only migraine medicine that consistently gets rid of my migraines. I&#039;ve tried Zomig, Imitrex, and many others - but Maxalt gets it gone in 15-30 minutes and I&#039;m back, up and ready to get back into life. I can even take one at work and just rest my eyes at my desk until it kicks in. Never could do that before."""
Ethinyl estradiol / levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""Hi Everyone I had a bad experience with this birth control​. I was taking another birth control before this one. I switched to this one bc of my mood. And around the 3rd month I went crazy. I started to think weirdly I started to think I didn&#039;t love my boyfriend anymore.  And I know it&#039;s not true but it is the WORST. I went off it about a month ago and I still have the worst depression and anxiety. I can&#039;t even look at my boyfriend the same anymore and it breaks my heart. But I heard it gets better and these thoughts will go away. Remember ladies  never act when your on birth control it&#039;s not you! But this made my realtionship the worst.  So I needed a break from birth control after this one a break is well needed! 

Good luck ladies!"""
Lisinopril,High Blood Pressure,"""Made me feel tired, depressed, but did lower my blood pressure. I only took it whilst I worked on getting my blood pressure down with exercise and diet. I have been off of it for a couple of months now and am bursting into life again! Still, it did its job well."""
Escitalopram,Anxiety,"""I am a mom to two sweet, high energy toddlers that challenge me every minute of the day. I did start feeling on the edge and extremely stressed with my older son. Now I have been on Lexapro for almost two months and so far I like it- feel more patient and calmer, but not a Zombie. I was very scared to gain more weight on top of my remaining pregnancy weight, but actually I started losing weight since my appetite decreased. I hope it continues. I am on 10mg. The side effect- super low libido and possibly feeling a bit more tired. If that&#039;s all I am going to experience, I will stick to it for for another 5-6 months. Overall it is way better than Celexa or Zoloft for me. Good luck!"""
Norco,Pain,"""These just don&#039;t help me at all and they claim that they are the same as Lortab 7.5 but they are wrong. Lortab help me much better than these do. If they are the same then why call them Norco and change the looks of them. Nobody is fooling the patients that have been in severe pain"""
Tioconazole,Vaginal Yeast Infection,"""Okay so I didn&#039;t use the egg I just used the gel and I wasn&#039;t sure if I had a yeast infection or of it was BV. But I decided to try it anyway. Well I inserted it about 8:50am and immediately felt and intense and bothersome itch. So I laid down and took deep breaths and finally after about an hour the itching is gone for the most part and the yeast infection feels like its going away. Guess I&#039;ll find out tomorrow. I would recommend the gel any day other than the suppository. Sorry to hear you guys are having issues with it."""

Ethinyl estradiol / norgestimate,Birth Control,"""I started Tri-Sprintec a month ago, not by choice but because that was the only thing the health department had in their inventory.  The nurse told me it was exactly the same as the other pills. I could definitely tell a difference in myself though just after starting them! My emotions were out of control and I kept going into deep depression mode! My appetite was pretty much gone too so I wasn&#039;t eating. A good tip is to keep a journal once you start a new pill so you can keep track of break downs, mood swings and how often they&#039;re happening. I had a break down at work, crying in front of my boss and everything.  I decided to stop the pill and since then I&#039;ve felt great. """
Magnesium hydroxide,Constipation,"""I had jaw surgery 2 weeks ago and I have to be on liquid diet for maybe less than 6 weeks but can also have very soft foods. After a week and half I started eating scrabled eggs and then a couple days later I had to go poop and COULD NOT come out. It was painfull and to the point I was crying, then I was researching on what is the most effective out there... Magnesiam Citrate. I went to walgreens with my dad and he said when he was a child, this was the BEST solutions that helped him out on his constipation. When I bought the Wild Cherry flavor of MOM Phillips I took it right away. It Immediately helped out the cramps because it was extermely painful then I went to take a long nap then 5 hours later IT CAME OUT LIKE A DREAM. Try it Please!"""

Ethinyl estradiol / norgestimate,Birth Control,"""I have been using this pill since May of this year. It is also the first pill I&#039;ve tried. It is a great pill, my monthly cycle is on time and the same week every month only downside its 6-7 days instead of 5-6 like I had before. It has prevented pregnancy for me, I did realize my boobs got a little bigger, my sex drive is the same as it was, no weight gain and there&#039;s bad cramping in the beginning of my cycle but then it goes away. Overall it&#039;s a great pill and it does do its job. I would recommend it to anyone who is thinking about starting birth control."""
Junel Fe 1 / 20,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,"""I&#039;ve taken countless birth controls mainly because I used to have awful, heavy periods and I have had to switch numerous times due to a problem always arising with the BC I take. I have always had clear skin. Not perfect; a breakout here and there, but nice skin. I have been on June Fe for 2 months now and my skin is horrendous. I have back acne. My chest is even breaking out. I have bumps all over my forehead and cheeks (I have NEVER had acne on my cheeks) and even starting to come up on my neck. Do NOT take this for acne. Luckily, I haven&#039;t had any severe mood swings or depressions which is why I switched BC pills last time. I heard this medication was bad about making you crazy or depressed.

Talked today to a friend having comparable symptoms. Stopping this drug immediately."""
Vistaril,Sedation,"""My psychiatrist just prescribed me this medication to help me sleep at night since I have trouble sleeping, supposedly it takes 15 to 45 mins to take in effect, the only effect I got was a calming effect but wasn&#039;t sleepy like it was intended for..therefor I became more agitated, crying for no apparent reason, and more fidgety then ever..So unfortunately I was the unfortunate one where it does not work for."""
Implanon,Birth Control,"""Got Implanon in April 09. It is now October and I have had only one week without spotting/bleeding since it was put in. Was not bad getting it put in, but six months of this? It&#039;s driving me crazy to always be wearing a tampon. I wouldn&#039;t know how my sex drive is cause it has prevented most of that from happening."""
Rabeprazole,GERD,"""I&#039;ve been taking Aciphex since 2001 and it has worked wonders on my GERD.  Before I retired from active duty in 2003, one doctor switched me to another brand.

Azithromycin,Chlamydia Infection,"""Learnt that I had chlamydia, went to the doctor and he gave me 2000mg of this medication. A little bit or nausea followed by a half day of diarrhea. I&#039;ve had it before with the same symptoms, everything cleared up in a few days"""
Sertraline,Depression,"""Made me wake in the night with hot sweats. Constant dry mouth. Insomnia was awake for 36 hours straight.

Plan B One-Step,Emergency Contraception,"""I had sex with my boyfriend the day after my period ended, the condom broke and he ejaculated inside of me. We immediately ran to the nearest pharmacy to buy the plan b pill after we discovered what had happened. I took it within an hour of the incident. 7 days later I started bleeding, it felt like a period because it lasted for about 6 days, but this was only plan b helping me shed my uterine lining to prevent the fertilized egg from attaching to my uterine wall. I had my period 4 weeks later. Plan b works, don&#039;t worry that much if you&#039;ve followed the instructions and took it within 72 hours of unprotected sex."""
Duloxetine,Depression,"""Went nearly mad on this antidepressant, clenched my teeth, constant sweats. Terrible and always tired on it. Doctor just kept upping the dosage. Was on 120mg when I complained, changed doctor and am now coming off Cymbalta. Now have dreadful dizziness and brain zaps but anything is better than what I was going through. """
Verapamil,Migraine Prevention,"""I have only been taking verapamil for less than 2 months. It took 2 weeks before I got relief from my chronic migraines. It was a wonderful feeling until my ankles started to swell and had intense pain in my feet, legs and hands. I just started to wean myself off of this med and already have relief from the swelling ankles and pain. So back to the Doc to see what else she can offer. I hate taking meds and think I will try a chiropractor and see what they can do for my migraines."""
Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,"""I just want to share this because I didn&#039;t see it on any other post. I&#039;ve been using Drysol for over two weeks now on my forehead and scalp (yeah, weird place to sweat, I know) and it has been awesome. Before this I would always get salty sweat into my eyes while playing sports or dancing... that time has gone! Thanks Drysol!"""
Escitalopram,Anxiety,"""I&#039;ve been on and off Lexapro for 6 years. I got off it twice thinking I was completely fine and then a year later (both times getting off) my anxiety came back tenfold. I am back on Lexapro now and happier than ever. Many people are scared of being on medicine or asking for help but we are all made differently and some of us need medicines to live a fuller, more amazing life. Lexapro has enabled me to accomplish things I didn&#039;t see possible and allowed me to relax and enjoy life more! Everyone has their own definition as anxiety but to me if your anxiety is interfering with your every day life then try everything you can to remediate it. I have tried yoga, vitamins/ other homeopathic remedies and as much as I wished they worked, they didn&#039;t."""
Implanon,Birth Control,"""There are many options for a teenager, young women or even an adult to chose for birth control, I chose the implant. I chose the implant because it was number one in from keeping a girl pregnant, don&#039;t receive your period, and it last three, even four years! There is also side effects to this type of birth control. The implant made me gain a little weight and it stings very bad when the guy ejaculates inside of you, but that&#039;s just the implant doing it&#039;s job. All in all, I recommend this birthcontrol!"""
Minoxidil,Alopecia,"""Works but is a lifelong hassle."""

Before using Aldara she feels in great shape."""
Linzess,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,"""I have tried to take this several times, with no success. My Dr Prescribed this for IBS-C. I can&#039;t take it in the morning for fear of incontinence. I took it last evening and woke up at 2am with liquid stools and severe diarhhea about every 15 minutes for about 6 hours. This medication will be going in the trash. So not worth it. I&#039;d rather be constipated and take Dulcolax."""
Voltaren,Rheumatoid Arthritis,"""I have fibromalgya too - its been helpful as a painkiller!"""
Levetiracetam,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have been on Keppra (levetiracetam ) since Nov for seizures. I have been on Bipolar medications for 2 years. The Keppra I started has literally CHANGED MY LIFE! I am no longer in a manic tornado. The twister I call &quot;life&quot; has stopped. I move at the same speed as others now instead of challenging myself to be the best, FASTEST and efficient mover 24/7. My thoughts are no longer racing. I can finish the thought clearly. It took about a month to really stop stop noticing the wretched side effects of starting Keppra or levetiracetam. Well worth it. """
Ethinyl estradiol / norgestimate,Ovarian Cysts,"""I have had a couple bouts of cysts, it is the reason why I got on bc. I took it regularly for months and it did fine as a bc I suppose. It regulated my period, made them a little less severe. However, it didn&#039;t necessarily help prevent the cyst growth. I also had some episodes on my period while on this birth control and they were still debilitating. I also experienced a ruptured cyst while on the medication. When I finally got to the gyno we decided to have me take bc on a constant basis, skipping the inactive to try to further reduce cyst possibilities and eliminate period. However, this has caused me to have thick brown discharge EVERY day for 2 months. We are now trying a different pill- hopefully that helps."""
Gleevec,Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia,"""Gleevec got my CML under control in less than a year. Taking it after dinner was the best time for me. The cost is the biggest downside to this drug. It is not covered by my insurance; therefore, it is very expensive, but worth it."""
Buprenorphine / naloxone,Opiate Dependence,"""I started taking Suboxone (Bupe/Naloxone) 8mg strips 6 months ago, and now I am down to 4mg. Trust me when I tell you that this drug will save your life if you have an opiate addiction, but you must follow your doc&#039;s orders. I was snorting 5-10 30 mg oxycodone&#039;s (roxi&#039;s) a day, and heroin when desperate. Opiates ruined my life I lost EVERYTHING! Now I am back in college full-time, and got my life back. If you are dealing with opiate addiction do yourself a favor, and make an appointment with a Suboxone doctor, and seek out counseling. This drug works if taken responsibly."""
Sprintec,Ovarian Cysts,"""About 4 1/2 years ago I had surgery to remove a corpus luteum cyst and another cyst that burst. Since then I have been on Sprintec with no other cyst relates problems.

Bactrim,Bacterial Infection,"""I have gained about 5 to 8 pounds since I have been taking this medicine."""
Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""I had the Skyla inserted on Friday the 14th. I took 2 ibuprofen before hand and in my opinion that didn&#039;t help! Insertion hurt pretty bad I broke out into a sweat fast. Pain was not unbearable and it only lasted a couple minutes. I had some cramps that night but not too bad. All in all everything went good a few minutes of pain is worth the 3 years piece of mind.  I have not had any spotting but I have also been on birth control pills for almost 10 years so I don&#039;t really get a period anyway."""
Propranolol,Anxiety,"""Really excellent medicine for alleviating the physical symptoms of anxiety. I was sceptical about taking this as my anxiety (or so I thought) was mostly manifesting as mental anxiety. I now realise just how much I can reduce my anxiety levels as a whole by taking this medicine. I&#039;ve only taken it twice - 40mg once a day, although I think 60mg may be the sweet spot for me. I don&#039;t get uncontrollable heart palpitations, sweating, voice cracking, and fully body shakes. In fact I feel comfortable and in control, hence, my thoughts are clearer and less agitated and thus the mental anxiety is also somewhat relieved."""
Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""I just got my Skyla put in (8/2/16) and honestly, it really comes down to how well you can handle pain. I handle pain fairly well and it did cause discomfort as the procedure occurred. My doctor explained it to me in 3 steps. Measuring your uterus, holding your cervix, and insertion, which means only 3 really tough cramps. 

Luckily, I was able to drive myself home right after and haven&#039;t felt any kind of discomfort. So far, I&#039;m really loving it and I&#039;d say do your research, ask your physician and if everything&#039;s checks out, do it. The pain is well worth it."""
Roxicodone,Pain,"""I have been using this medication for about 6 months.  Roxicodone 30mg every 4 hours.  It does work great takes the pain away within a short time period about 15 minutes once taken.  I have had 17 surgeries and have been unable to do a lot of things until I started taking this medication.  I don&#039;t feel tired or get a &quot;high&quot; feeling. I am happy I found a medication that works for me. Only one bad thing - I had when some of my medication was stolen.  I had to stop taking it.  I thought I was going to die  -  I was in bed for 3 days.  Like they say on this site put all your medicines up and follow the directions.  I wouldn&#039;t want anybody to have to go through withdrawals on this medication.  """
Quetiapine,Generalized Anxiety Disorde,"""I&#039;ve been taking quetiapine 25mg day and night for about a month now. I find it is great for taking away anxiety, but I am so so tired could sleep the clock round. I&#039;m also on 20 mg Cipralex for depression. I have no energy to do anything. """
Hydrocortisone,Addison's Disease,"""This medication is life sustaining.  I take a total of 20 mg divided into several doses throughout the day.  It has supported muscle development so that now, after a year of treatment I am a healthy weight for my height and am able to live an active life.  No digestive issues.  No sleep issues.  No other side effects.  My blood pressure has increased to a healthy level.  I no longer have spells of dizziness or see stars."""
Liraglutide,"Diabetes, Type 2","""I have been on Victoza for 10 days at 0.6 and the side effects have been minimal - just a bit of abdominal disturbance late morning and a feeling of tiredness in the afternoon. I have been injecting before breakfast but am thinking of moving that to last thing at night to see if it makes a difference.
Blood sugar readings first thing in the morning are definitely lower. Did feel a loss of appetite in the first few days and ended up missing out lunch, but found I was then eating a lot for supper, so have tried to stick to three meals at day and just keep the portion sizes small. Will no doubt be moved up to a higher dose after the first month but hope this does not cause any additional side effects.  Also take 2500Mg Metformin daily."""
Abraxane,Breast Cance,"""This medicine saved my life! I received it weekly for 6 months."""
Ortho Tri-Cyclen Lo,Ovarian Cysts,"""So, I thought the light periods were a problem but since I see people with the same issue that makes me feel a little better.  Although, I don&#039;t like that I come on at the end of the pack I usually would come on the Wednesday during the non- active pills but now its like Saturday or Sunday, then extremely light for maybe 2 to 3 days.  Good thing is I do not have problems with the Cysts or Fibroids now, no pain, periods are once a month although light, No acne, mood swings are normal, I think :-) overall good pill."""
Methotrexate,Psoriasis,"""68 year old male who has had Psoriasis for 46 years with coverage up to 90% of my body.  No one would initially R(x) me methotrexate so I flew to Trinidad from Canada to see a doc there that would prescribe it.

I was on every research pgm my cream  passes could put me on PUVA, Soralyn, vit A, coal tar, retanoic acid, that stuff that turns everything purple (can&#039;t recall name).  Finally I had to see a head shrinker as I was fairly emotionally messed up.  He R(x)ed me methotrexate 2.5x3 every 12 hours for 36 hours,  said not to drink and that I should get liver bios.  I&#039;ve had 10 invasive liver bios in 46 years 10 years ago I said no thanks no more. I&#039;m clear."""
Contrave,Weight Loss,"""I have been on this medication for over a month at the highest dose. I haven&#039;t lost any weight and it has caused chest pain, so much so that I had to get an EKG. It has also  caused severe upper stomach pain, I wouldn&#039;t recommend this medication to anyone it&#039;s not worth the cost!!"""
Thyroid desiccated,Underactive Thyroid,"""I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism 1999 so  Dr put my on levo. I never felt any different as years past symptoms got worse. My levels become worse I then was diagnosed with hashimotos thyroiditis.  My weight up and down now up then down. The fatigue was so severe I thought about ending my life.  Having two boys that wasn&#039;t an option. After years of levo  Drs upping the mcg I got sick of it stopped taking it. I could not function on it. It was like a sleeping pill to me. I was bloated all the time my hair was breaking off   I made appointment with my dr a few weeks ago. After all these years I told her my issue with levo.  Well let&#039;s see your number and I&#039;ll put you on armour. It&#039;s the best ever had. I wake up as though I&#039;ve slept."""
Zyban,Smoking Cessation,"""I&#039;m 21 years old and I used to smoke 25 a day for 3 years. When I first started taking Zyban I honestly wasn&#039;t sure if I wanted to quit or keep smoking but I thought why not try!
For the first 8-10 days my morning dose made very nauseous and feel like I was either going to vomit or faint but I never did.
since I set my quit date with zyban I have never touched a cigarette since and it has been 6 months now.

the only caution I would like to share is that it only takes away the cravings !
You still have to say no too having a cigarette."""
Lupron Depot,Prostate Cance,"""Had my first injection of Lupron 7.5 mg in July; second injection at the same dosage is set for August 21. So far no hot flashes or side effects. Have been taking Casodex simultaneously (30-day supply) which will end shortly. Only side effect from that initially was fatigue, which resolved after 5 days. Decided to insist on 1-month Lupron injections instead of a 3-6 month extended dose as PC support group participants on the once-a-month dose had far fewer side effects. I&#039;m sticking to my guns on this one; MD tried to give me a 6-month dose right off the bat. I&#039;m switching MDs and glad I did it this way. Hope this helps others."""
Adalimumab,Rheumatoid Arthritis,"""I am 47 years of age and was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis at 28. I have been incapacitated every day since my diagnosis and for the last 3 - 5 years I have had difficulty driving, walking, shopping and leading a &#039;normal&#039; life. This has led to a poor quality of life due to constant pain and depression. I started taking Humira about 8 weeks ago. One week after commencing I woke up feeling very strange. It took me a few hours to work out I was completely pain free. I hope it continues to be effective. It has changed my life completely."""
Alosetron,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,"""This medication is a God send. My irritable bowel syndrome had gotten so bad that anything but water would trigger an attack. I couldn&#039;t go to school or karate, it was stressful thinking about leaving the house.
With Lotronex I can now do all things I couldn&#039;t. I don&#039;t have to worry about where the closest bathroom is, I can enjoy myself. I am so glad my insurance authorized this medication."""
Diphenhydramine,Allergic Reactions,"""Best drug for me to wake up with good sleep and not have a headache.  I have used it for 8 years for allergies (itchy eyes, bug reactions) and my house always has it in stock.  Love the drug!"""
Azithromycin,Chlamydia Infection,"""Literally the worst side effects!! I was trying to focus on falling asleep because it felt like my stomach was twisting and turning and I was going to throw it up. 20 minutes after taking 2 pills, I threw up all over myself in bed! I ate crackers before hand to put something in my stomach. My heart felt like it was going a million miles an hour only 10 minutes after taking them, worst experience with any kind of medicine I&#039;ve ever had in my life. Now I have to turn around and take them AGAIN because of course they weren&#039;t effective in 20 minutes. Luckily the doctor prescribed me Reglan (used to help with nausea) to take before I take the azithromycin. Hoping I DON&#039;T have the same experience all over again."""
Vilazodone,Depression,"""I&#039;ve been in chronic pain with chronic fatigue for 30 plus years: fibromyalgia and CFS. This caused many years of depression. Took other SSRI&#039;s over the years but was always teetering on the side of depression. Cymbalta did nothing for me except weight gain.  My Dr. gave me a trial pack of Viibryd. When I started the 40 mg, I experienced severe GI upsets....heartburn, growls &amp; grumbling, gas, &amp; nasty taste on my tongue. I also had vividly violent dreams as soon as I fell asleep. I reported these complaints to my Dr. and he lowered my dosage to 20 mg. I still have a little gas and a violent dream every once in a while, but my depression &amp; energy is so much better. I feel like &quot;me&quot; again. I definitely recom- 
mend giving Viibryd a try."""
Ethinyl estradiol / levonorgestrel,Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,"""Not good! I&#039;ve tried regular Seasonique as well as LoSeasonique and although yes, it did get rid of my cysts after only one month, the LoSeasonique caused me to have breakthrough bleeding for almost the whole time that I took it (9 months). Some days it was as much blood as having a period and I even had cramps and nausea that I usually have when I have a period. With regular Seasonique the spotting only happened for the first pack (3 months), but still made me nauseous. But all in all, LoSeasonique&#039;s side effects of being in a period-like state for 9 months straight do NOT outweigh the benefit of helping with PCOS."""
Moxifloxacin,Bacterial Infection,"""2nd day on the 400mg.....crazy side effects. Felt like a bad mushroom trip. Really messed me up. I swear I heard the sloshing around of blood pumping while completely zoned out"""
Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""28, never had kids. So I had skyla put in the 19th of November. The experience of having it put in is something I wasn&#039;t prepared for. It wasn&#039;t that it was cramps, I felt more of intense pressure then anything else. 9.5/10 pain.  I&#039;m now a week in to having it and let me tell you, I am an emotional wreck. One minute I am happy, next I&#039;m definitely not!  I have no idea how long this is going to last, but I sure as hope not for long. It&#039;s ridiculous. Now, as for the bleeding. I have not had any of the spotting, or anything of the sort. So that&#039;s a plus. Occasionally I will feel slight cramps but only really minor. As for the sex part, my partner has felt the wire or thread a few time during intercourse. So thats not fun.."""
Asenapine,Post Traumatic Stress Disorde,"""I have been on Saphris for about 5 weeks. I started at a low dose, 5mg at bedtime and just increased to 10mg a couple days ago. I love this medicine! I sleep at night and wake up feeling good in the morning, I haven&#039;t experienced that in YEARS! 
My PTSD episodes have greatly decreased in intensity, duration and how often they occur. 
I really do feel like a new woman!"""
Epclusa,Hepatitis C,"""I was diagnosed with Hep C and chronic Cirrhosis stage 3 a day after my 62 Birthday. I have been in recovery from Alcohol and Drugs for over 32 years but was IV user in 1974. Total surprise and shocked. I felt fatigue this last year, had some discomfort in my stomach area and some nosebleeds as well as headaches. I have always been healthy and this was out of the ordinary for me. I have been on Epclusa for 6 weeks and feel so much better. Very minimal side effects of headache and joint pain as well as sweating specially when in direct sunlight. I am so pleased with this treatment and thankful every day when I take the medication. Co-pay of $5.00 is amazing."""
Copper,Birth Control,"""Apparently there is a word limit here so I&rsquo;ll try to get my point across. This is NON Hormonal, a lot of bad reviews with complaints that a hormonal BC would cause. Paragard doesn&rsquo;t have hormones and therefore SHOULD NOT cause the affects that some of the other reviewers are complaining about. Also Copper poisoning is not an issue, read the studies done. You have no more copper in your body than what&rsquo;s already naturally there. So don&rsquo;t feed into the negative feedback. Do your own research and discuss with YOUR doc the best option for you. I personally LOVE paragard."""
Yaz,1</span> users found this comment helpful.,"""It made me a lot more emotional and anti- social. I also gained weight but that&#039;s expected in birth control."""
Eluxadoline,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,"""Started this five months ago and in the first week I was totally fine. It stopped all symptoms. Felt great. Ate what I wanted. After being diagnosed over 20 years ago and managed well with diet most of the past years. A year ago I was back to 8 trips to the bathroom with immediate diarrhea daily at least 4-5 days per week. Viberzi was amazing. Went to pharmacy this week to pick up refill. Had. Note to call doctor. Had to take me off immediately. Has been black listed for patients without gall bladder. Doc wanted me on on lotronex. Has also been black listed for tissue death in intestines! I stopped medication on Thursday and I have had immediate resumption of diarrhea. Can&#039;t leave the house. Have to travel to a conference for work all week."""
Seroquel,Insomnia,"""I would NOT recommend taking this medication for longer than a few weeks for insomnia. It works amazingly well at first, but then, over the course of time, you will need to up the dosage to get the same result. Over time, you will find that the medication makes you groggy and can cause weight gain. Then, when you try to get off, it is very, very hard. I was only on 50mgs for 6 months, and it has taken 2 months for my sleep to occur naturally more than in 2 hour increments. Overall it made my insomnia worse."""
Temazepam,Insomnia,"""Great pill. Much better than Xanax or any other benzoyl for that matter
.  Not prescribed very often here in US but if you are lucky enough to get it prescribed then enjoy the rest and the peace and serenity beforehand"""
Celecoxib,Period Pain,"""I have tried just about every drug on the market for my cramps and after a while they all just stop working. I took Bextra and Vioxx which are similar before they were taken off the market. I take it a day before my period starts and usually only a few days into the week and finally I&#039;m not missing out on life or work anymore. I do get blood tests to check for any abnormalities, but after 3 years there are none so far. I take the brand name, simply because the manufacturer co-pay makes it $4 a month, which is less than my $7 month co-pay with my insurance. Both my parents take this for their arthritis now and my 26 year old sister just started this for her cramps. I&#039;m constantly telling everyone how much I love Celebrex."""
Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""Experienced extreme hair loss. At first sex drive was through the roof. After six months it dropped to zero. I have lost at least 1/3 of my hair and started having really bad cramping and abdominal pain. It comes out on Monday thank goodness. Would NOT recommend this but everyone is different."""
Abilify,Schizoaffective Disorde,"""Doctors added Abilify with Celexa (antidepressant) and Geodon and I finally feel normal."""
Tioconazole,Vaginal Yeast Infection,"""OMG! I had a little YI due to antibiotics. Symptoms were not too bad but felt it coming with probiotics. I felt so much worse, burning and itching since I put it in and the outside cream is not working. I thought I had taken this another time  I was antibiotics but it did not feel like this!! It is horrible!! I just hope it doesn&#039;t last. Will not do this again!!"""
Fluorouracil,Basal Cell Carcinoma,"""This is my second time around. I am on Day 10 of a 14-day regime; then steroid cream for another 14 days. I am in excuciating pain and I look horrific. I know it&#039;s a good thing but it is so painful. I wanted to write here to help encourage others; I found this site because I needed encouragement. I use a dish towel with fringe to flap against my face and that&#039;s the only relief I get. I forget how awful I look until I catch myself in a mirror."""
Carafate,Stomach Ulce,"""I had an (undiagnosed) bleeding ulcer (from gastric bypass surgery). Doctor prescribed the liquid form, but $500 for the liquid?? The pharmacist kindly told the pill form is $4. Ugh, I hate this stuff! I am supposed to take it 4 times a day, but it starts dissolving the moment it hits the back of my throat... Its like tasting nasty sand! The coughing fits almost get painful, and then it feels like it i&#039;explodes&#039; in my stomach- so I can forget eating for the next 3-4 hours. Ugh. Seems I have a choice (my &#039;pouch&#039; is still very small 5 months out), take this OR have room for hydration OR food, not all of the above, am asking my doc tomorrow about it..."""
Rizatriptan,Migraine,"""My migraines started on April 2 2016, I have had a constant headache since then, with the 13 migraines, after a CT scan in my neck, I have a long which needs to be removed, which could be the root cause for this ongoing headache however finally I was prescribed maxalt today after almost 4 months of suffering headaches and migraines,and taking other pain relief, icing it, quiet rooms, limiting bright light stimulation ,msiisng out on family and friend events and I cannot believe the difference it&#039;s made. I don&#039;t like taking medications, I try to do things naturally, think this really really helped, and I have so much relief.

Victoza,"Diabetes, Type 2","""I began taking this drug at the 1.2 mg level. Within a half day I began having serious side effects. I thought I had a very bad virus. I had headache chills nausea vomiting diarrhea insomnia. I missed 3 days of work. I stopped taking the drug. A month later I tried it again at the .6 mg level. First half day ok w just no appetite but then all happened again- vomiting and this time cold symptoms. I began having horrible diarrhea last night and called off work today. This is 48 hours after I stopped taking it. I threw rest away this drug feels like poison to my body"""
Desogestrel / ethinyl estradiol,Birth Control,"""I first started with the NuvaRing and ended up having to get my gallbladder removed. I have been on reclipsen for 3 years now and the only pros for me are that I do have much clearer skin and am not pregnant BUT I have awful migraines multiple times a month so bad that I now have a prescription from my neurologist also have basically NO sex drive which is driving my boyfriend insane. And I am insanely sensitive and cry almost everyday during the placebo week."""
Ativan,Anxiety,"""Ativan 0.5mg calms me down considerably within 30 minutes, but the side effects are so bad that I can&#039;t continue to take it. I experienced EXTREME, loss of energy, tiredness, laziness, apathy, and increase in appetite.  This might be okay for someone who&#039;s at home trying to recover from panic attacks, but not for me. I work 5 days a week and this past week that I was only taking 1 x 0.5mg pill a day was the absolute worst week I&#039;ve ever had at work, living in a fog and totally wiped out of energy. I hardly got ANYTHING done which is totally out of character for me.  Also when this medicine wears off in a few hours it makes me very irritable and nervous. """
Gabapentin,Pain,"""I am still in pain after breaking a bone in my hand over two months ago. It is still broken after one month in plaster. My hand is so swollen, my fingers won&#039;t bend. They cannot operate until swelling subsides. My doctor has prescribed 300 mg one a day. I have only taken one tablet."""
Doxycycline,Acne,"""I&#039;ve been taking doxycycline once a day since early August and overall I have seen improvement but I still get pimples randomly I think it could be from touching my face though. I do that often and am trying to stop because I know it messes with the healing process and spreads bacteria. Anyways I don&#039;t have as many breakouts as I used to and yeah it&#039;s all starting to clear up but I still have a long way from perfect skin. I have scars from picking. I also put Retin A on every night and wash my face with neutrogena to clear pores. I put on a face mask 3 times a week either sea salt, baking soda, or just the face wash because it&#039;s also a mask. I also apply apple cider vinegar once in a while. I think these do help as well."""
Mirena,Birth Control,"""My doctor told me that this was the smartest and safest option especially for teens (lower hormone dosage) she even has one herself. She did say the placement would be painful so she prescribed me one 5 mg pill of Valium to take an hour before and told me to take 800 mg of ibuprofen with the Valium. I got there feeling very relaxed and I also think it made the entire process a lot less awkward, usually I would have found both the position in front of the doctor very weird, let alone an assistant she needed to come in halfway through that said &quot;nice to meet you&quot; haha a great time to meet someone. The whole thing took about 10 minutes and really didn&#039;t hurt, I give credit to the meds, I got some cramps once they hit my cervix and some after."""
Saphris,Bipolar Disorde,"""Bad drug I wonder If all the good reviews  on the internet was written by the Company behind it ...first i took 5mg X2  The morning dose made me sleepy at the point that I can&#039;t stay awake for 5 minutes...Now I take 10mg at night It makes me sleep for 12 hours (Can&#039;t wake up) &amp; gave me Flat affect- totally impaired Thinking- Loss Of hope in life - Suicidal thoughts -Problems in tongue &amp; Talking ( bec.

Amoxicillin / clarithromycin / lansoprazole,Helicobacter Pylori Infection,"""I was diagnosed with H.pylori a year ago and finally did Prevpac.  I&#039;ve had terrible diarrhea since starting - took my last dose today.  Generally, my stomach was always churning and the diarrhea was consistent while on the treatment.

Hydromorphone,Chronic Pain,"""Had a motorcycle accident in 2013 and broke 3 vertebrae, 6 ribs and my pelvis. I was given morphine in the ER, but it wasn&#039;t putting even a dent in my pain. I asked if there was anything else they could give me and dilaudid was the answer. IV administration quickly relieved my pain. I describe the feeling as melting into the bed in a feeling of euphoria. I was told by hospital staff it was 8 x stronger than morphine. Easy to see how people get addicted. I was disappointed when the nurse told me they were going to start weaning me off after 3-4 days."""
Lysine,"Herpes Simplex, Suppression","""Lysine is a wonderful amino acid that suppresses cold sores (fever blisters/herpes simplex/HSV-1).  It is also good to take Vitamin C and E with the lysine, but cut down on any supplements and foods high in  L-arginine such as chocolate, peanuts, gelatin, white and whole wheat flour, wheat germ, carob, oats and coconut.  The ratio between lysine and L-arginine plays a role in HSV-1 and HSV-2 as does stress and not getting enough sleep."""
Pregabalin,ibromyalgia,"""I have Chiari with Syrinx, osteoarthritis and a secondary fibromyalgia. This medicine is definitely helping my pain. I am taking 50mg morning and night. At the moment I am just topping up with paracetamol and codeine if required. It gave me headaches initially but that is settling now. No other real side effects.
I have been on these three weeks and can honestly say that I&#039;m impressed with the effect. I even did a bit at the gym today as my pain is much better controlled."""
Plaquenil,Rheumatoid Arthritis,"""My Rheumatologist prescribed this for my rheumatoid arthritis and it is like a miracle for me. For the first time in several years I actually feel like getting out and doing things without restrictions. The joint pain has lessened and my rash subsided!  I do plan on making an appointment for an eye Dr. due to some irritations I recently have been experiencing. All in all, I would highly recommend Plaquenil and hope you can see and feel the difference."""
Depo-Provera,Birth Control,"""I started Depo as an alternative to the pill due to the fact that I kept forgetting to take it. At first, it was a miracle. My period immediately stopped. I did gain a bit of weight, but it wasn&#039;t anything that I thought about too much. But after my third round of the shot is when problems started to occur. I became incredibly unstable. My moods were unbearable to the point where it almost cost me a relationship. I was constantly depressed, no sex drive, and the scale kept climbing even after efforts to eat healthier and exercise. I decided to go off of it and everything just stopped. I feel normal again. My weight dropped. """
Lurasidone,Bipolar Disorde,"""I was recently diagnosed bipolar type 2 with mostly depression episodes. I was before on citalopram for 6 months after burning out in April. Latuda has really helps with the mood swings, I&#039;m much more happy, social and productive. It&#039;s effect is almost instant. I&#039;m on 10mg and will up to 20mg soon. The only negative effect I&#039;ve experienced with Latuda is brain fog. It&#039;s been challenging for me as I am a university student. With Citalopram I would get straight As, study long periods and memorize 200 pages in 2 days. With Latuda, I have trouble memorizing a paragraph. I also tend to forget stuff. Psychiatrist says it will get better with time. Even tho I enjoyed Citalopram, I had terrible side effects. With Latuda, none. I finally feel normal."""

Modafinil,atigue,"""Provigil (modafinil), literally changed the entire course of my life! I was prescribed this medicine for off-label use to treat depression &amp; acute chronic fatigue. I also have BiPolar II, and I have had only minor difficulty with increased mania. The only reason I did not give this amazing medicine a 10 Rating is because I have experienced issues with building tolerance - that is - its effectiveness began to subside about 5 months after I began to take it. At that time I was taking 100mgs once a day in the mornings. My Dr. and I decided to increase the dose to 150mgs once a day in the morning and I felt terrific again! It&#039;s about 6 months later now, and again the amazingly wonderful effectiveness has decreased a great deal."""
Dulcolax,Constipation,"""I took 2 pills at 6 pm right after supper and by 3:30am I woke up to excruciating abdominal pain. I went to the bathroom and could not sit upright on the toilet. I sat there for about 15 mins and had a bowel movement. I crawled back on the bed and almost passed out. I was sweating so bad and cold chills. I&#039;m jerking all my clothes off laying naked. I was hurting so bad. I moaned and rolled on the bed from the pain. It&#039;s 7:35pm the next day, been over 24 hours since taking the medicine and I&#039;m still cramping. I&#039;ve had 6 bowel movements so far. I thought maybe my body just couldn&#039;t handle laxatives but reading other reviews it could possibly be the product. Never again will I take a laxative."""
Mirena,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,"""I have had the mirena inserted now for a little over 2 years. It was suggested to me by my doctor for excessive bleeding and needing iron injections every 3 months. I was 40 when my periods became excessively heavy to the point of being unable to leave the house due to having to change every 30 minutes! I also started to regularly get migraines where I would be bed ridden for 3 days with a bucket in a dark room, not the best situation when you have 2 children under 2! The mirena has not only lightened my periods beyond belief but I have not had a migraine for 2 years!! I have my life back and it can only be the mirena.

Doxycycline,Acne,"""I am 18 and was prescribed Monodox with a topical creme &quot;Veltin&quot; and have been on them for almost a week. So far I have seen small improvements and I will post another update either when it completely clears or at the end of the month.

Butoconazole,Vaginal Yeast Infection,"""I totally loved this product the first time it was prescribed to me. However, I found that the other times I have had this treatment (including now) it takes longer to relieve symptoms. I&#039;m losing hope as I have become immune to all other medications."""
Trazodone,Insomnia,"""None of you mention your Doctor&#039;s instructions on how to take Trazadone.  I think the biggest problem I am reading about could be solved with the proper instruction.

Mucinex D,Cough and Nasal Congestion,"""Took one pill before bed (about 8 pm) and was up, literally all night.  Fell asleep the next morning at 9 am.  The pill worked great on my sinuses but should have taken it in the morning.  The packaging does not detail this side effect very well."""
Amitriptyline,Interstitial Cystitis,"""I was diagnosed with IC after so many real UTIs and some that were not. I felt like I always had a UTI. In November of 2011, I was diagnosed. It was so severe I had the cystoscopy immediately. I started installations and took various medications. Getting on amitriptyline was great until 6 months later I was in day treatment not understanding why my mania and depression were off the chart. The doctors could not stabilize me and I was hospitalized twice for suicidal thoughts and psychosis. Just beware if you have mental illness, this medication may counteract bipolar and other mental health meds!!"""
Omeprazole,GERD,"""I&#039;ve been having problems for years with my stomach and GERD.  I was put on prilosec and was told that it would possibly cause an upset stomach to begin with but to try to work through it.  I took it for around 5 months but I could not handle it anymore.  I kept stomach cramps and an upset stomach the whole time.  I couldn&#039;t keep enough fluids in me to keep myself hydrated.  Months later I was prescribed it again and tried it once again.  Same thing but worse.  I had bad blood work come back saying my kidneys weren&#039;t working right and my potassium was so low I was admitted into the Hosp.  Since then my kidneys are still not OK.

However, my periods now last over 2 weeks at a time (I&#039;m on mine right now and it&#039;s now the 20th day) they aren&#039;t super heavy but it&#039;s enough that I have to wear a tampon.

I started taking this medicine after my sister told me she had started taking it and how wonderful she was feeling.

Ethinyl estradiol / levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""I love this pill! I had pretty bad acne before starting, and my face cleared up within the first pack or two.

Zomig,Migraine,"""I have recently gone to a headache specialist after thinking no one is going to help me with my migraines and constant tension headaches. She gave me Zomig and it does really work. The first time I tried it I wasn&#039;t 100% sure my headache was a migraine since it felt different then the one I&#039;ve always experienced. It wasn&#039;t throbbing from front to back all on one side but it did really hurt bad all on one side. I was pleasantly surprised. Maybe it was a different kind of migraine since I have just weaned off of Excedrin and 2 years of Tramadol use. A couple of days ago I had a bothersome headache that had been off and on in intensity for 2 days then turned into the normal migraine I have been accustomed to and the Zomig took care of it."""
Ketorolac,Pain,"""Have been suffering with a severe throats infection for 3 nights now. Been on antibiotics, aspirin and ibuprofen. Saw a Dr today and was given this injection of Tiraspol.

Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""Had Mirena inserted about 4 months ago. Although periods are milder there is spotting frequently throughout the month. Sex drive has decreased dramatically and have gained close to 12 lbs. I feel no discomfort with the Mirena IUD, however am disappointed by the side effects considering at 40  metabolism has already slowed down so this does not help."""
Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,"""WARNING! I received two injections, and it was the worst 6 months of my life. This should come with EXPLICIT warnings, but didn&#039;t.  I came down with severe anxiety and depression.  My life fell apart and I had to leave town to regroup.  My interpersonal relationships unravelled. I was so depressed I couldn&#039;t move.  I saw a pyschiatrist and he suggested that the depression could very well have been due to the depo shot - he&#039;s seen it affect others like this as well.  Also, I rapidly gained 15-20 lbs.  It&#039;s been 8 months since my last injection and I am ECSTATIC to report my period finally came back. It can take that long to leave the system! This is a dangerous drug. Monitor your mental health closely. In fact don&#039;t do it"""
Nabumetone,Muscle Pain,"""I started taking this medication about 2 months ago for severe neck pain.  I could barely turn my neck and I dealt with constant pain.  I had been on medications in the past, had radio frequency ambulation, and injections.  This present medication has made me a new woman.  I am able to go about my daily routines, without pain.  I highly suggest this medication if nothing in the past has worked."""
Fentanyl,Pain,"""I started taking fentanyl after trying every other opiates available and finally found relief. I&#039;m on the 25mcg patch. I&#039;m in the 36 hour right now on the first pass and so far it&#039;s perfect and surprisingly has my pain on a 9 out of 10 taken care of with breakthrough medicines. I felt the patch when I finally slept in for once this morning without having to wake up to the pill schedule. """
Levothyroxine,Hashimoto's disease,"""I have been taking this for 5 days now and today I have had excessive sweating, hot flashes, and heart palpitations 2 different times."""
Rizatriptan,Migraine,"""Maxalt is the only migraine medicine I have tried, and it works well for me.  When I take it early (before it becomes a full-bloomed migraine), it works within maybe 30 minutes, completely getting rid of the pain.  I do have some side effects: most of the time, I feel a tightening of the throat for about 15 minutes after taking it (my doctor had warned me about that), and if I happen to be a bit tired when taking it, I feel a bit dizzy for a couple of hours.  But it sure beats a 24-hour migraine."""
Implanon,Birth Control,"""Im 27 yrs old mother of 2 and I&#039;ve had the implanon for a yr and a half and the first week my mood swings were crazy, I was crying uncontrollably at times...when I got the implant I was 105 never had any weight issues in my life, now I hungry all the time, I never feel full or satisfied, I&#039;m now 122 and I&#039;m not happy about it..I wanted to wait the 3 yrs before removing it because it costs so much but Im considering taking it out very soon...also since being on this I have a full 7 day period every other week and I went to the doctor about it and all they wanted to do was pit me on the low low estrogen daily pill, I&#039;d I was any good at taking a daily pill I wouldn&#039;t have gotten the implan js."""
Clindamycin,Bacterial Infection,"""I took the probiotic (2 hrs before/after) this antibiotic and still slept in my clothes the first night because I was convinced I may be having a heart attack and may have to go to the ER.  Now, I&#039;m taking Pepsid, as well, but today had to stop on my way to work because the hearburn is so severe. On day 3, I forgot the probiotic and had severe diarrhea - so don&#039;t do that.  The dental surgery was mild by comparison - I stopped the prescription painkillers after the first day - but the antibiotic is killing me."""

Bupropion,Major Depressive Disorde,"""I hated this medication. It gave me insomnia, I was agitated and fidgety all the time. I was on it for 3 days and noticed I couldn&#039;t handle it. I was on for 200mgs per day. In order for me to sleep I had to take 10mgs of melatonin. I was good prior to being on antidepressants. I was also shuddering and had tremors."""
Mirtazapine,Anxiety,"""I am pleased to say, that I have been taking Remeron for about 4 months after recovering from severe acute pancreatitis, including surgery and a 5 1/2  month hospital stay.

Tegaserod,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,"""I&#039;ve suffered from severe abdominal pain and constipation since I hit puberty. I was in such pain that I would pass out from it. After a week of taking Zelnorm I felt completely better and I didn&#039;t pass out once from pain while I was on it. It was what got me through 2 years of high school, when before I was constantly hospitalized from it and couldn&#039;t attend school. I was taken off of it because my doctor was worried about the side effects and the pain and other problems came back, just not as aggressively. I learned to deal with it, to ignore it and the pain slowly went away. I recently had an attack for the first time in 4 years, that was extremely severe and I passed out. I don&#039;t want to spend another year in and out of the hospital..."""
Lithium,Depression,"""I&#039;ve been on 75mg venlafaxine and 60mg mirtazapine for quite some time, with generally good results. Though my depressive symptoms were largely improved, I remained suicidal and lacking motivation in life. I recently added 300mg of lithium carbonate, and have noticed some improvement with the suicidality. My main complaint is that I am less socially engaging, as if there is nothing to talk about, I could just be quiet most of the day. My mood is relatively flat, I&#039;m not sure if I will take it for long but it is worth a try."""
Aclidinium,COPD,"""It has changed my life it&#039;s a miracle I tried everything. I&#039;m a new person."""
Ethinyl estradiol / levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""I was prescribed Aubra through planned parenthood and I&#039;ve been on it for about 2 months. I love it so far, I don&#039;t feel any symptoms and no weight gain. I was previously on the depo and I HATED it!! I gained about 25 lbs in less than a year. Birth control is different for everyone so I didn&#039;t know what to expect. I&#039;m hoping this stays this way!"""
Levonorgestrel,Emergency Contraception,"""After having sex for the first time and not using a condom, I picked up Take Action 2 hours after and ladies it definitely works! I was super stressing out because I was 2 days late but it&#039;s better than being pregnant. But I&#039;m having the worst cramps ever and extreme nausea to the point were I have no appetite.

Ocella,Birth Control,"""Had severe mood swings, dry eyes to the point of not being able to wear contacts, weight gain, breast tenderness.  """
Adderall,ADHD,"""I started this when I was 27 years old, diagnosed as ADHD. I have had problems my entire life with struggling to stay awake (in general), excessive daydreaming, and socializing. This medicine turned my life around. Not only was I able to stop daydreaming, finish a task and make a list (for the first time ever), I felt more confident carrying on group conversations. I also lost a lot of weight, which I did need to do."""

I&#039;m very familiar with constipation. When offered movantik 25mg every morning, I happily took it and within a day I was going easily but with a cramp pain. After a few more days, my guts started killing me so I stopped taking movantik. 11 days later severe constipation returns. Doc and I think since I&#039;ve such a high tolerance my gut experienced physical withdrawal so today starting on ~8mg (~1/3 of 25mg tab) every 2-3 days. Anyone else taking Movantik similarly?"""
Norethindrone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,"""I have been on this pill for a year now. I went a while without a period just constant spotting. Well, I can&#039;t tell if it&#039;s an extremely light period or just spotting. It&#039;s not enough blood for a tampon or pad but a liner. I hate it bc if I do want to have sex, I have to act like I have to pee right before just to make sure I&#039;m not bleeding. I&#039;m on my last pack &amp; then I&#039;m done with it. I also was on this pill due to high bp &amp; horrible periods. I&#039;ll take my risks at not taking this anymore!"""
Meperidine,Pain,"""Just wanna say Demerol is the best pain reliever I&#039;ve ever taken. I received in the ER through IV. I have Crohn&#039;s disease and it worked better then anything else I was given."""
Clonazepam,Anxiety,"""This medicine works the best of all the benzodiazepines for me. It has completely wiped out my anxiety and has zero side effects at my prescribed dose (2.5mgs a day total). The only problem with it and all benzos is that it is very hard to come off of once you have been on it for awhile. I don&#039;t think enough doctors stress the dependence factor of this medicine (it is very difficult to withdraw from, you need to decrease your dose very slowly over a long period of time), so educate yourself if it is prescribed to you and use the lowest effective dose. The pros outweigh the cons for me by far though."""
Vilazodone,Depression,"""I have taken just about everything on the market, with 1 week of starting Viibryd, my life was completely changed.  The best 30 days of my life, then I went from the sample pack to the prescription and it has been down hill for almost 60 days.  I have put on almost 15 lbs, the worst night terrors of my life, my sex drive in the 1st 30 days was through the roof, now nothing.  I cannot sleep, my anxiety was back and I became suicidal.  I have been off of Viibryd for 6 days, the withdrawals are rough and this is even after the step down process.  I was hoping that this would continue to be the best medication ever, but not for me.

Minocycline,Acne,"""It was a great medication for clearing up my cystic acne! and kept my face very clear while i was taking it but it didn&#039;t help my scars or redness on my face if anything it made it worse being so sensitive to the sun now that i have stopped taking it its all coming back :(:(:("""
Macrobid,Urinary Tract Infection,"""Took 1 pill 50mg because I&#039;m sensitive to medication. Within 2 hours, I itched everywhere. Took 25mg of Benadryl. Breathing is slightly labored as well. Dr reassured me I&#039;d be okay. I&#039;m limited to use of antibiotics due to severe allergic reactions. I feel nauseated and have a horrible headache. Was given this for kidney stones and high red blood cell count indicating unknown infection. I wish this would go away on its own ugh!"""
AndroGel,"Hypogonadism, Male","""I have been using AndroGel for the last two months and the results are great. More energy and more sex drive. I will be 50 soon and AndroGel makes me feel young again. Thanks to Androgel I do not need to take Viagra."""
Cozaar,High Blood Pressure,"""Started 25 mg Cozaar for hypertension when 100 mg atenolol   25 mg hydrochlorothiazide didn&#039;t lower my blood pressure and after lisinopril had me coughing 24/7.  A couple of days after I started taking it, the tops of my feet and my ankles started to swell, I couldn&#039;t wear my shoes.  I quit taking it, but when my doctor found out, she made me go back on it.  I was okay for a couple of weeks, but the swelling came back, slightly mitigated by compression hose but only slightly.  Back to the drawing board."""
Skyla,Birth Control,"""I got the Skyla put in.  Procedure was very similar to what I had read in all the reviews online.  Felt like some severe period cramping, but nothing that was unbearable!  I had waves of cramping throughout the rest of the day, took a little nap, but was able to go grocery shopping and even went out in the evening with no problem.  Felt mild cramping throughout the week.  Have been comfortable with it since!  Neither I nor boyfriend can feel it during sex.  Completely covered by insurance.  Worry-free birth control.  """
Humira,"Crohn's Disease, Maintenance","""I have had Crohn&#039;s disease for about a year and a half and Humira has been amazing. I felt relief within one month and was in remission within 9 months. Life is pain free..only side effect is yeast infections every week and feel like I have the flu the week right before due for shot. Shot is painful for 10 seconds, but it is worth it. Remicade is only other option, using it as last resort. Otherwise very satisfied."""
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""I got this implanted into my arm exactly two years ago.. my doctor has now recommended me to get this taken out of my arm as soon as possible do to my abnormal weight gain. Sadly, I have gained about 60 lbs since having this birth control. My periods after the first year have been very irregular. All of this birth control method has prevented me from getting pregnant,  all the other side effects aren&#039;t worth it. I have an appointment within the next few weeks to get this taken out of my arm."""
Kariva,Birth Control,"""It&#039;s kept me to where I cannot have kids which is a good thing. Sex drive is still as usual. The weird part is I don&#039;t get periods anymore. Which has caused me to fear I was pregnant, but otherwise it&#039;s fine. I have symptoms of menapause, but I am an 18 year old girl so I can&#039;t have it just yet my guess is the side effects?"""
Contrave,Weight Loss,"""I took Contrave for three days and decided to stop because the nausea was too much to handle, feeling as if I would throw up an any moment.  I&#039;m sure it works for some, but these feelings aren&#039;t worth it.  Additionally my energy was sapped, it was somewhat counteractive in that I had no desire to work out, I just wanted to go home after work and sleep.  I typically lift three days a week, and cardio twice a week.  I&#039;m not sure where to go from there, but I&#039;ll find something.  I weigh 168 and am 5&#039;4.  I was hoping to lose twenty pounds for an upcoming vacation, not with this drug."""
Metronidazole,Diverticulitis,"""I ended up in the ER with diverticulitis and was given Cipro and Flagyl. Yes the taste is bitter and things don&#039;t taste so good. However, despite the taste, I have gotten significantly better with the two medicines and that is the main thing for me. As with any medicines some of us will experience different side effects if any, but if this is one of them, this is very minor. I did not experience the nausea or a lot of other ones I read about with these medicines."""
Lamictal,Bipolar Disorde,"""The help I received from Lamictal was outstanding.  It took a few weeks but my down cycle wasn&#039;t nearly as bad and the mania all together stopped.  In time the cycles all stopped.  BUT the side effects were too much to handle.  I started to lose hair, my fingernails were so think I broke nails typing (even on many vitamins and prescription vitamin D). I would bruise just by a bracelet resting on my arm for a few minutes and then the bruise wouldn&#039;t go away, the worst side effect was terrible circulation.  I have been on Topamax and experienced the poor circulation they talk about all the time, but this was something else entirely. I couldn&#039;t feel my finger tips and my feet had NO feeling.  My hands were ice cold all the time."""
Strattera,ADHD,"""Makes me super depressed unmotivated and unable to enjoy anything. Does increase attention span at the cost of not wanting to do anything."""
Zyban,Smoking Cessation,"""When I first took Zyban, I was confident it wouldn&#039;t work. I smoked much more than I used to during the first week, and then suddenly I couldn&#039;t smoke at all. 

After 3 months on Zyban, I have been extremely happy that I finally beat this addiction. I&#039;m no longer taking the medication and do feel like I want a drag or two. 

All in all, I would say it is a miracle drug...no matter what people tell you, it IS worth it. Be sure to follow what your doctor tells you, it&#039;s plain and simple: 2 tablets per day for 9-12 weeks and you will never ever smoke, if that is really what you want. 

I hope it helps everyone the same way it helped me."""
Clonazepam,Panic Disorde,"""I checked myself into a mental hospital in 2011 and was put on this three times a day. I was eventually cut down to as needed and it&#039;s still wonderful. Kpin (as I call it) curbs the panicky feelings within minutes and I sleep so well that it&#039;s sometimes hard to get out of bed in the morning! Thank you, Roche--your little yellow pill is fantastic!"""
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I started out at 319lbs on 8/23 I have been taking it for just over a month now and the results are more than what I have expected and more weight than I have ever been able to loose. I started taking this medication because I have been overweight for my whole life and I was ready for a change. I got Phentermine prescribed to me and I have taken it regularly for the past month and now I am down to 289lbs. I can most certainly say that I feel better having lost 30lbs and it has been a great start in my journey to become healthier and more fit."""
Nitrofurantoin,Urinary Tract Infection,"""I was prescribed this medication for my uti. I was asked to take it 2 times a day for 5 days. I took the first dose before I went to bed. I woke up at around 6 with chills. I went to use the bathroom and fainted. I was very dizzy the entire day. I couldn&#039;t walk without getting help. I couldn&#039;t sleep because of horrible lower abdominal pains I was having. I also had very bad chest pains. The next day I woke my body was in so much pain. I had sharp pains in my stomach the entire day. I stopped taking these pills and I would never recommend them to anyone."""

Especially switching from a strong opiate to Embeda?"""
Trazodone,Insomnia,"""25mg puts me to sleep but I wake during night repeatedly.
50mg puts me to sleep but I still wake up during night, maybe a bit less%u2026 AND I get medicine head/fog in the morning, which I don&#039;t like.  I like when my morning coffee clears the cobwebs, but with this drug, the cobwebs hang around so I&#039;m left wondering, &quot;why bother taking it?&quot;.
Gonna take 50mg tonight just because I need to get a better night&#039;s sleep than last 2 w/out it.
Desperate so trying again."""
Varenicline,Smoking Cessation,"""I started smoking the day I turned 18 and at first it was just as a joke, but over time it became an addiction (I am 4 months shy of being 20). My family and friends hated that I smoked but I didn&#039;t care until about a month ago when I tried to go on a hike and was quickly out of breath - I hated it. I decided to quit smoking and started taking Chantix only 5 days ago. I had planned on smoking through the whole first week but on day 3 I realized that I wasn&#039;t craving it as much, and now on day 5, cigarettes taste absolutely terrible. I do experience some side effects: nausea, fatigue, stomach pain, and amazingly vivid dreams (not scary, unless you count a cat being able to literally multiply every few minutes as scary)."""
Welchol,"Diarrhea, Chronic","""Diagnosed at 18, went on until 28. I had a miserable existence for 10 years. 5 minutes after eating, I better be near a toilet. Gastroenterologists tested and tried so many different things with no success. Told my GI I was having a substantially lower quality of life with this problem. He prescribed me Welchol. The next day, I enjoyed my first meal in years and cried. Truly was a miracle pill for me."""
Oxymetazoline,Nasal Congestion,"""This medicine should be ILLEGAL. It is extremely adicting and within only about 2 days of taking it your symptoms will be 5 times worse. I have been unable to breathe without this medication for around 4 years now. Tried many times to get off it but with no luck. I&#039;m simply convinced that it has damaged my sinuses beyond repair.

I&#039;m begging you DO NOT take this. It may work wonders at first but within a day your nose will be completely blocked again and you will have to rely on the medicine again. It&#039;s a vicious circle."""
Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,"""Before I tried this pill I tried so many others and the experiences were bad. This is the only pill that I feel like myself on! It probably is because this is the lowest dose pill available. Why put extra hormones in your body if you can prevent pregnancy and lighten periods with the minimal amount of hormones? I really like it! I&#039;ve recommended it to several friends and they are liking it too!"""
Gilenya,Multiple Sclerosis,"""I have been taking Gilenya for close to 10 months now.  I was on Rebif and suffered horrible side effects that never did go away ( flu symptoms, migraines ).  I had a very severe relapse where I lost the ability to walk for months.  I started the new pill medication and have had no side effects whatsoever. What a relief! I can&#039;t tell if it&#039;s working, I guess time will tell and if I ever relapse again.  It&#039;s a very expensive medication, thankful my extended benefits cover it.  I would recommend this if Tysabri is not for you ( JC Virus positive ).  A few laughs in light of a serious health problem...I am a mad cow! lol.  And those of you who are JC positive - you will know what I mean."""

I had lost 10 lbs, I didn&#039;t want to stop.  The doctor suggested I cut the pills in 1/2 and to try to eat and drink more often, comes out that it worked for me.  I would take a 30 day supply, cut the pills in 1/2, and I don&#039;t do weekends, after that 30 day supply was done, I get off the pill for a month...make sure I don&#039;t just regain the weight.

I stopped taking antibiotics after three months and two months later my acne came back. Now I&#039;m back on the same dose again. Hopefully with time I will see long term improvement."""
Levothyroxine,Underactive Thyroid,"""For 5 years I have been telling my doctor that something was wrong... her suggestion was to exercise more... but when a person always feels achey, tired, depressed, and all around lifeless, it is hard to motivate yourself to exercise MORE! My thyroid tests never came back at a level she felt was too abnormal. FINALLY, in the last 2 months I have been so sick and it takes her that long to check my thyroid and guess what, WAY underactive. I have been on this medication for 3 days and last night for the first time in over 2 months I slept for 7.5 hours! (average was 3.5 hrs a night) and I feel AMAZING! I feel so energized and ready to conquer the world! No side effects thus far, but it has only been 3 days and I understand that can change."""

I wake up in the morning to bump into every possible wall, my vision is completely blacked out. I can&#039;t walk for more than a mile, without feeling faint. I eat well and drink lots of water (due to a horrible experience with Vyvanse, in which i lost 20lbs) Not only that but falling asleep is killer. I&#039;ve never taken such a small dose, and have such poor results."""
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""I had the Implanon inserted in my arm 01/09.  For 6 weeks I had no period, which was great, then in March I started to bleed, and bled until the end of June.  I stopped bleeding for 3 weeks.  After the 3 week break it started right back up.  Since March I have also been very depressed, anxious, and just felt PMS all the time; my OBGYN put me on antidepressants for a few months, she said that it should not be related to the Implanon, but I cannot help but feel that it is since it coordinates with my bleeding.  I have not had any weight gain, but I do not feel like I have been myself for 8 months now.

Drospirenone / ethinyl estradiol,Birth Control,"""I&#039;ve been taking Yaz for 4 months now, I&#039;m 16 years old. Few complaints, at the beginning this pill caused me horrible nausea and breast pain but that could be due to changing to Yasmin from Microgynon 30. Also I experienced spells of depressive moods which have now cleared up but I often experience mood swings! On a positive note my skin has cleared up massively and have maintained if not lost weight, great pill."""
Androderm,"Hypogonadism, Male","""My doctor started me off on 5mg patches. The patches created itchy, red &quot;polka dots&quot; on my body.  The red areas were about one and one-half inches in diameter. They frequently itched and sometimes the red area would become irritated and swollen. The worst part is that it took at least two weeks for the spots to disappear.  I stopped using the patches after one month.  I asked my doctor for AndroGEL.  The gel does not give me any irritation at all.  The gel comes in small pre-measured packets.  After applying, you must then wash your hands.  With the patches, I didn&#039;t need to disrobe to apply them.  With the gel, you pretty much need to remove your shirt (or pants) so that you can rub the gel into your skin."""

Hydrocodone,Pain,"""I am suffering with Arachnoiditis of the thoracic spine due to 2 arachnoid cyst surgeries. Zohydro is far superior at lowering pain levels. It also does not upset my intestines or cause liver damage. At pain reduction it is A            The best pain reliever ever. It also does not have the ups and downs in regards to pain levels that Norco&#039;s have.

Yesterday I went the 2 minutes walk and I was feeling dizziness and not stable on my feet. I was also more anxious and afraid and faint and worried about passing out. The first few days I got headache that&#039;s very strange, not the headache I normally get, but different one and it went away after.

I suggested that 1st exposure = sensitized &amp; 2nd exposure elicits reaction. Pedi finally agreed with Mom&#039;s assessment, prescribed oral steroid. Six days later, moderate symptom control on double dose benadryl, 20mg prednisone, albuterol for shortness of breath. Dr says not anaphylaxis. I suspect otherwise &amp; have epipen. He&#039;s only comfortable when medicated. Bad drug!"""
Keflex,Bladder Infection,"""I have a double whammy: I have interstitial cystitis (which feels like a constant bladder infection), and on top of that I&#039;m prone to actual bladder infections. I&#039;ve learned to be able to tell the difference between a bladder infection and a cystitis flare up. I have A LOT of drug allergies and can not take sulfa drugs or Cipro, which are commonly prescribed for bladder infections. Keflex has been the ONLY antibiotic that I can take that doesn&#039;t give me any side effects AND gets rid of the infection. It&#039;s saved my bacon on numerous occasions. I also prophylactically take Acidophilus orally and douche with plain yogurt to avoid yeast infections. It all works like a charm. I have NEVER had a bad side effect from Keflex."""
Diltiazem,Not Listed / Othe,"""Been taking cartia xt, 120mg twice a day since 2011 for pvc&#039;s, pac&#039;s, occasional svt, and non-sustained a-fib unrelated to the chest pains I get quite frequently. It helped a lot, but the doctor recently upped my dosage to 180mg twice a day for chest pain that I am now experiencing from coronary spasms due to a myocardial bridge diagnosed via catheterization! Hopefully, the increase in dosage will stop all these terrifying spasms."""
Lexapro,Generalized Anxiety Disorde,"""I was on 20mg of Celexa for 4 years for euphoric disorder. About 1 week before my period I would feel creepy cawling tingles up my spine and into my brain. I would have white hot temper outbursts. I was also abusing alcohol. Geez, great times. Now I haven&#039;t drank in 7 years. Celexa at that time was a God send. Never felt better.
Than 3 weeks ago the medicine stopped working and I had to go to the ER twice in 1 weekend. The anxiety, vomitting, nausea, hot flashes and cold sweats were unmanageable. Finally my friend who is a Internist suggest Lexapro 10mg. I agreed and took it just like Celexa, before bed. I woke a new woman. All side effects gone, and normal feelings of happiness are in my heart. First day, so things may change, but I&#039;m better."""
Nexium 24HR,GERD,"""Love it, it&#039;s a life saver and if u forget to take it, you will get upset."""
Acetaminophen / hydrocodone,Pain,"""I have been taking Norco for about a year now and it works for me with very little if any side effects. I had surgery on C2-C3, C3-C4, C4-C5, C5-C6. The surgeon wants to cut again on C7. Had a plate with screws put in neck in 2006. I have Degenerative Disc disease with severe bilateral neuroforaminal stenosis. I take 10/325 of Norco three times daily and it helps the pain and is keeping me from surgery on C-7. Only 30% of all neck surgeries are successful and will stay on Norco to prevent surgery as long as it works and for now it is working, with no side effects."""
Buprenorphine,Chronic Pain,"""I wanted to say that I have been taking this medication for about 3 months now. To put it into perspective, I told my doctor that I had actually laughed the previous week. I have chronic pain from spinal arthritis, foot, knee, and leg pain from arthritis and spinal nerve pain from damage from shingles. I was miserable. I still have pain, and have to be careful not to overdo it, or I have break through pain. But this is a good thing because I don&#039;t want to do more damage to my joints. I take gabapentin for nerve pain. I wanted to say that my doc prescribed an asthma puffer to put medication on my skin before I apply the patch. I spray it on by depressing the puffer, and then spread it very gently. No rash. I forgot once and had blisters."""
Propofol,Anesthesia,"""My first colonoscopy with versed/fentanyl was miserable...long-term memory loss and severe depression (never had it before).  Next colonoscopy was with propofol with same results but with the added treat of having my BP crash and getting admitted.  Just had the repeat exam unsedated and it was easy and not uncomfortable except for mild cramps for a few seconds."""
Zyprexa,Depression,"""I started taking Zyprexa over two years ago for intrusive thoughts I was having as a result of Obsessive compulsive disorder/depression.  While the Zyprexa helped remove intrusive thinking, it added about thirty pounds onto my slender frame, made me severely tired, and took away my sex drive.  In addition to these adverse effects, I was unmotivated/uninterested in many activities that used to give me pleasure. I had a &quot;so what&quot; attitude about life in general.  All because of this medicine.  What really frightened me about taking this was my cholesterol went sky high, and my blood sugar was also very high, making me an at risk candidate for diabetes.  I am finally off of this. """
Copper,Birth Control,"""I LOVE my paragard! I was on the Mirena for 3 years but decided to switch because of some hormonal side effects I was getting. The Paragard has been perfect. Getting it placed is painful as expected but no different than my experience with getting the Mirena. I get some cramping with my period but it is completely manageable and does not keep me from exercising and going about my normal activities. I need to take Midol the first day or two but that always does the trick. My period is 5 days long - the first day or two are mild, day 3-4 are heavier, and day 5 is moderate. I haven&#039;t had any problems leaking with tampons/out of control heavy periods. I have had it in for 3 months and couldn&#039;t be happier. I feel great!"""
Prednisolone,Inflammatory Conditions,"""I have had a very stubborn sinus infection that just won&#039;t clear (6 months +). The doctor prescribed 7 days - 30mg of Prednisolone. 

The first three days I felt great. A lot of energy, clearer breathing, better sleep however after then it went downhill fast. 

My anxiety and panic sky rocketed after a year of being fine. I was shaking, weak legged, dizzy constantly, my heart rate was through the roof (felt like I had drunk 10 coffee&#039;s). I had worst sinus pressure and headaches as well. 

About day 5 it made my sinus problems worse as well, congestion, mucus production was in overdrive!

Three days off them now and still haven&#039;t not calmed down. Back to the GP we go :("""
Losartan,High Blood Pressure,"""I had been on reserpine (rauwolfia serpentina) for about 10 yrs.. It worked great for controlling BP and kept me in the 110/70 range. But in the last 2 yrs. I started having constant stomach pain which turned out to be a side effect and had to stop. Switched to lisinopril which caused a constant throat tickle, but worked. 
Switched to 50mg losartan a couple months ago and it didn&#039;t control BP that well. It drifted up to the 154/85 range with some higher spikes if I had coffee. The losartan also gave me a persistent dry cough. Now on 80 mg valsartan twice a day and so far not too impressed. BP continues to be higher than desired. It&#039;s effectiveness for my body is about the same as the losartan. May need to switch to a different class of meds"""
Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,"""I do not recommend this birth control! I&#039;ve been taking it for almost 3 weeks and my body feels completely different. This pill made me very nauseous, bloated, moody and tired. It also made my periods closer together and my cramps more painful. Definitely going off of it."""
Sinemet,Parkinson's Disease,"""terrible depression, mood swings, not helping tremors seems same as before I was taking them, might ask doctor to stop giving it one more week, I have been taking for 6 weeks"""
Liletta,Birth Control,"""I had Liletta inserted on the 9th, it is now the 13th. I am a 27 year old woman with no children or pregnancies. It was a painful insertion and I did have a cold sweat after the procedure. I would not recommend working on the day of your procedure; I had the day off. I was on my period as is procedure for IUD insertion and it stopped about a day afterwards. I am not experiencing heavy bleeding or spotting. I just had sex with my boyfriend and he could not feel the strings or device. I am pleased with it and would recommend Liletta to friends or other women who are tired of taking pills every day. I know it is only a few days into having it but again I am experiencing NO HEAVY BLEEDING. I am certain my period will be almost non existent!!!"""
Tramadol,Depression,"""Hello everyone. I, as many of you, have struggled with major depression for a long time. For me, it comes and goes - with a terrible onset towards the end of the winter month&#039;s. I&#039;ve tried 4 different antidepressants with no success. Actually, Wellbutrin did help - but I ended up being allergic to it. Go figure. I was prescribed Tramadol for pain last year during a hip problem I was having and wow did it help my mood. I didn&#039;t feel so broken. This year I am suffering from depression again but haven&#039;t started on Tramadol yet. I am nervous because of it&#039;s addictive qualities, but I cannot keep calling out of work and risk losing my job. It is a terrible feeling. All your posts have been very encouraging so thank you for sharing!"""
Epiduo Forte,Acne,"""I was terrified to use epiduo after reading the reviews but once I realized I had to buffer it, it seemed much more approachable. If you&#039;re not used to using retinoids, don&#039;t put this directly on your face and don&#039;t use it every night. I took a pretty conservative approach and mostly been able to minimize pain/flaking. 

Here&#039;s what I do:
-Wash my face with a gentle cleanser (I use Aveeno Positively Radiant)
-Put on some cerave moisturizer
-Wait 20 minutes
-Put on the epiduo forte

I only do this at night, once every 2-3 days. If I feel my skin getting irritated, I&#039;ll stop using the epiduo till it gets back to normal. Don&#039;t muck around with your skin! If it&#039;s irritated and awful, no reason to torture yourself and use the epiduo every night just use it every couple of nights"""
Versed,Light Sedation,"""This works great when they listen to you and give you enough. """
Benlysta,Systemic Lupus Erythematosus,"""Worked very well, controlled symptoms and put me in remission. Felt like I did 20 years ago - pre SLE and Siscoid Lupus diagnosis!

I had a serious anaphylaxis reaction after my 3rd infusion from not being premedicated by my previous rheumatologist.  

Changed physicians and continued treatment with pre-medication of Benedryl and Solumedrol in i.v.  It worked for 5 treatments and then I had a reaction a 2nd time and was removed from the infusions.

Doctors say had I been premedicated from the very beginning, I more than likely would not have had a reaction.

My remission is now over and I am worse than prior to Benlysta treatment.

Benlysta co-pay program paid for 100% of my deductible, as well as $7,000 in co-pays each year"""
Gabapentin,Pain,"""I have very little memory of my time taking Gabapentin - which is part of the problem with the drug.  For some people it&#039;s OK, but for me my memory from that time is like a black hole.  I remember starting it, a few flashes while taking it, but I don&#039;t remember tapering off the drug.  It&#039;s like I lost 6 months of my life.  I couldn&#039;t even tell you if it helped with the pain."""
Doxycycline,Acne,"""For those who are dealing with symptom, make sure to take a full meal before you eat for me it eliminated the nausea completely. If I take it to long after I take the medication or don&#039;t eat I&#039;ll either vomit or can barely move with nausea."""
Diclofenac,Osteoarthritis,"""I tried others but they did not work as well as PENNSAID, I recommend Pennsaid, it works great on me."""
Oxymorphone,Pain,"""Works much better than the oxy&#039;s for my arthritis.  I don&#039;t get such wicked side effects, either. The Opana winds me up but not nearly as much as the Oxycontins.  Also, the hot flashes are nowhere close to what they were."""
Fingolimod,Multiple Sclerosis,"""I have been on Gilenya for 5 months now. No side effects. Great deal of relief from leg weakness and fatigue.   Numbness is greatly lessened but not eliminated. No relapses so far. I&#039;m extremely happy with this medicine. Only down side for me is the cost."""
ParaGard,Birth Control,"""Fatigue
Joint Pain
Depression
Loss of libido"""
Xerac AC,Hyperhidrosis,"""Absolutly amazing! I use it every night before bed and in the morning I go to school then work without having to re-apply it or any other antiperspirants. It works like a charm, I highly recommend. It may sting a little the first few times, but it is definitely worth it. I&#039;ve tried everything possible to stop from sweating but nothing worked, until I tried this."""
Baclofen,Muscle Spasm,"""Prescribed this by pain management doctor along with Roxy 15 mg. Made very sleepy- seeing no improvement with back pain/ leg pain over just taking the Roxy. Side effects are just too many for the slight relief it may have given."""
Ustekinumab,Psoriasis,"""Wow, what can I say, this medicine has changed my life. My head was the worst, completely covered. Had to put oil on it and leave it on most of day or over night. My head would be stiff after 3 days with the build up. After one treatment it was completely gone. So happy now. Was thinking about going on disability but now don&#039;t have too."""
Trazodone,Insomnia,"""I came down with an awful virus I soon could only sleep 5 hrs per night.

Trazodone worked well the 1st two nights but  I needed a kick start (ativan or Benadryl) thereafter but it definitely kept me sleeping through the night.

It&#039;s difficult to tell which of my symptoms were the virus and which were Trazodone but the faint headaches and prominent dizzines have definitely been the Trazodone. I also noticed I was becoming more forgetful and loosing my ability to focus. Anxiety may or may not be attributed to this drug also.

The final straw, I was watching a concert online but when I paused the video, I kept hearing the music. It was a pretty effective scare. I&#039;m done with this drug!"""
Thyroid desiccated,Hashimoto's disease,"""Ditto all the positives written by other reviewers.  

I don&#039;t understand why it was nearly impossible to get the clinic to prescribe....  I was so miserable on synthroid which I struggled with for 8 mo...with worries of health issues growing.  I quit. And for the next six years at every doctor appt. I flat out refused synthroid.  I think one of the 20 plus fillers was the issue.   Doing my own research I begin requesting Nature Thyroid.  Was told the clinic  only prescribed synthroid. 16 months ago I won!  And have been happy since on NT.  UNBELIEVABLE then when I moved and my new doc in different state suggested I change.  No way.  I&#039;m very happy with Nature Thyroid and think  the medical profession is 75 years behind the times."""
Yaz,Birth Control,"""I have irregular periods (1 per year) so I was put on birth control to help. When I was a teen I was on ortho tri cyclen and it worked just fine.  

I am 24 now and got a new Doc and was swapped to yaz, one pill for 28 days. I was on it for about a year. NEVER AGAIN!

I also have a tilted uterus so my cramps can be debilitating. Yaz was supposed to help. It made it worse. The cramps sat in my lower back and it felt like shooting pains through my who body. 

The worst part was I developed panic attacks. My mood was terrible. I was either angry or I cried every time I saw something lovey dovey on a netflix movie. 

My depression got worse. To the point where I thought I was going nuts. I finally had enough and asked to be put back on ortho."""
NuvaRing,Birth Control,"""I&#039;ve been on this Birth Control for about 2 years, I just recently stopped it in the middle of my 3 week cycle of it (I got my period 2 days after I took it out so beware). When I first started this I felt anxious a lot and always moody, definitely didn&#039;t have any libido what so ever. Also I gained so much weight, and I exercise and ate pretty decent where I shouldn&#039;t gain 30lbs all together. When it was about a year into the ring I gained about 15lbs then I stopped it for 2 months lost a few pounds easy and then put myself back on it and gained 30lbs. I really don&#039;t like it and don&#039;t plan to go back on it....it&#039;s funny when I stopped I lost 5lbs the next day."""
Dienogest / estradiol,Birth Control,"""Natazia made me moody (teary-eyed for no reason), caused me to have periods ranging from 3 days to 14 days, and caused ocular migraines as frequent as 5 days in a row."""
Suprep Bowel Prep Kit,Bowel Preparation,"""I read plenty of reviews.
I drank a gallon of water through out the day as directed by the physician. I had one 16ounce clear jello, one 8 ounce chicken broth and the rest was bottled water throughout the day. I held my nose to avoid the smell that I read about. As I was drinking it, I gulped it down and the taste was very familiar to me. It was like a cough syrup that I had when I was younger. I had the two sixteen ounce bottles of water. This stuff works very fast. I was in the bathroom for three hours."""
Neurontin,Pain,"""After the timing of using this medication is adjusted correctly (activation time for myself takes 2 hours for peak performance), it has helped allow me to sleep, and to take away the pain caused by nerve damage. Though it was not meant for it, it has also helped with chronic back pain, and pain in my hands. A fairly effective drug. Please understand that my use of this drug is not related to seizures, and so I cannot comment on it&#039;s effectiveness in that particular field."""
Tioconazole,Vaginal Yeast Infection,"""I called my mom saying I have a yeast infection and she told me she has used this product 100 times and it worked magically. I got home and used this and within the next 15 minutes I had THE WORST burning sensation ever. PLEASE IF YOU&#039;RE CONSIDERING USING THIS PRODUCT---DON&#039;T. I wouldn&#039;t wish this pain on my worst enemy. I&#039;ve had sour cream-like discharge come out and it isn&#039;t getting better. THIS IS YOUR WARNING."""
Saphris,Schizoaffective Disorde,"""I have the black cherry version because it is not as bitter.  This medicine is quite expensive however works well for me.  My paranoid thoughts still come to me a few times a week but I am not delusional at all.  My mood is stable and I feel very &#039;normal&#039;. Great Medicine!"""
Estrace Vaginal Cream,Atrophic Vaginitis,"""Very sexually active until severe abrupt menopausal symptoms at 55. AV symptoms the most bothersome as overnight I shrunk up, dried up, itched, burned and  tore. Intercourse was out of the question.
Dr. gave me a sample of Estrace Vaginal cream. I admit I was afraid to use it and had little faith that it would help so I used only a pearl size amount on clean dry skin every night for 2 weeks. That ammt. Is sufficient to cover all the external parts and more, it emulsifies.
I am COMPLETELY healed as far as pain with intercourse and also pain upon urination. It was a MIRACLE for me.
Side note: If you stop using it (3X a week after the initial 2wk nightly use) you&#039;ll be back at square 1.  I give Estrace  a 10+ rating C:
A tube lasted 6 months"""
Aviane,Birth Control,"""I originally started taking Aviane about 7 months ago because i had pretty bad acne.
After about 2 months on this pill my face had cleared up COMPLETLEY. I would get maybe one or two little pimples about two days before my period would come, but other then that I had nothing (which was really nice for me since I&#039;ve been struggling with acne since the 7th grade). Besides that I had no weight gain, no cramps. My period was a little irregular for the first couple months, but it got regulated, and they are great, light and only 3 days. I have tried other birth control pills including Orthro Tri-Cyclen, Mononessa and Previfem, but this one by far has worked the best for me."""
Clorazepate,Anxiety,"""I have tried various medications for anxiety/social phobia over the past 16 years. I have been prescribed several different antidepressants but none of them fix the anxiety. My doctor prescribed clorazepate 3.75 mg 1x a day (at bedtime) after my mother passed away and my anxiety got worse and I could not sleep at night. This medicine plus an antidepressant works so much better than an antidepressant alone. When I moved out of state my new Dr. wanted to take me off clorazepate because she said it is addictive. More Drs. need to realize this drug is a lifesaver for those who cannot tolerate valium, klonopin, etc. Clorazepate causes no side effects and I have never needed a higher dose in 8 years."""
Ethinyl estradiol / levonorgestrel,Endometriosis,"""I&#039;ve now been using Seasonique for a year and I&#039;ve been completely happy and unbelievably satisfied with this product. I have endometriosis so when my period came before I was on birth control it was dreadfully painful for the three to five days while I was on my period. I tried Yaz and it only made my periods regular, then I tried NuvaRing and that actually made my cramps worse and lasted for an entire week. After that I did tons of research and decided to try Seasonique. And for the past year I have only had maybe 2 hours worth of cramps the entire time. During the second refill I only blotted a little, but overall every symptom that follows endometriosis has disappeared! I highly recommend Seasonique. It&#039;s fantastic!"""
Trulicity,"Diabetes, Type 2","""Well, I am 24 hrs into the shot and so far (knock on wood) the only side effect is headaches (which I never have) but I can deal with that.

Just wondering how many days into it that the side effects (nausea &amp; vomiting) started with people that did experience these effects?  Will keep you posted after the week is up....."""
Combivent Respimat,"COPD, Maintenance","""Not real impressed don&#039;t know if anyone else has had this issue but when it gets to the red mark stops  dispensing medicine, and of course can&#039;t get it replaced. Also has been a few times when it didn&#039;t seem like any thing was coming out so had to double the dose so than you have most of that months wasted.Not happy at all have to wait for refill because of course you can only get one a month at a time so than you have to go without your medicine real fun fighting to breath. Company really needs to go back to the designers and come up with a better dispenser."""
Percocet,Pain,"""I&#039;ve tried almost everything else and now that my doctor has prescribed Percocet I can be a mom again...with no pain."""
Methylphenidate,ADHD,"""My son is 6 AND has been diagnosed with ADHD. Concerta is one of the medications we have tried. It does wonders for him during the day, he has GONE from being the class clown to top student. He always had it in him just lacked the ability to stay focused long enough to show it. However, during the evening is when we started noticing the difference it made in our child. He doesn&#039;t eat, he whispers even when everyone else was being loud, he became very emotional, and he would sit with a coloring books and color for hours... or sit at the computer playing games, he never slept . This was very unlike our son... he was usually climbing walls like spiderman... running around... jumping... happy go lucky! He became very withdrawn. We took him off it."""
Valtrex,"Herpes Simplex, Suppression","""I was supposed to take this for supressive therapy, but I stopped after my outbreak because I couldn&#039;t stand the side effects. This pill made me dizzy and I could hardly function at work. I don&#039;t know if this or the HSV 1 is worse."""
Rexulti,Major Depressive Disorde,"""I was severely depressed for several months. My Dr. Tried everything that I could tolerate. I am on Trintellix &amp; Klonopin. I started on the sample pack up to 1 mg. I snapped out of the hard depression within 10 days. I felt super. I talked Dr. in to an increase to 2 mg. I was irritable and nervous. I went back on 1 mg. and was back to my happy self. I would highly recommend  Rexulti to anyone with hard to treat depression. This medication gets a full 10."""
Vortioxetine,Depression,"""No serious side effects except for diarrhea  for the first few days. Not much of an appetite but improves over time. I take klonopin to help with anxiety and sleeplessness. You may also experience fatigue for the first few days as well so make sure you take it 12 hours before waking up in the morning."""
Phenergan,Nausea/Vomiting,"""I have had stomach problems since I was  a child, and so far no doctor has been able to figure out what the problem is.  The only relief I have gotten is from Phenergan (promathezine). I call it my &quot;miracle drug&quot;.  Even when already vomiting, and nauseated, if I take 25mg, in only about 15-20 minutes I am relaxed and  vomiting/nausea is gone. It does knock you out for a good bit though, but if you have been up sick for awhile, this will be a much needed rest.  Promethazine, you are my hero and I love you.  """
Implanon,Birth Control,"""I&#039;ve had Implanon for almost a year now. I supposedly had endometriosis, and PCOS. It was a little sore after the implant, but I don&#039;t bleed, (I never did) I just spot for about a day a month, if that. LOVE IT!! The only side effect is the implant gets sore around the time of the month, so I know when the spotting is coming. This is a MIRACLE treatment, and I don&#039;t have to worry about anything. My sex life is the same, I don&#039;t have any dryness or anything, and I have NO ring to worry about. ;) I love it! I&#039;m so glad I have it, and I&#039;ll be getting another in two years!"""

Duloxetine,Anxiety,"""I have suffered from anxiety problems my whole life, but it was easily managed until I turned 23 (2.5 years ago) when it blew up and every month got much worse. In Dec 2012, I was diagnosed with severe generalized anxiety disorder, moderate panic disorder, and moderate agoraphobia. I also have Irritable Bowel Syndrome-D, and combined with anxiety, I always had to be near a bathroom - any time I left the house I had diarrhea. Couldn&#039;t go shopping alone, do drive throughs, etc. Started this and almost immediately felt a bit better, minimal side effects (insomnia/headache 1st 3 days, itchy armpits 1st week) and it has taken the edge off lots. Have done many things I couldn&#039;t. No weight gain so far, very happy. Only big anxiety triggers bother me a bit, and Imodium use decreased LOTS! No mental fog!"""
Flexeril,ibromyalgia,"""I took this and I found rest. True rest. I have been given so many scripts, none did anything for the tight muscle pain, or the seizing of my muscles, which I thought was it for me forever. I have been given extended release medicines for sleep, and nothing. It took a while for me to realize I was not sleeping at night because of my muscles not relaxing. I took this at 8 p.m. last night, and fell asleep, I woke up at like 12:45, My habit from long term spasms...but then I went right back to bed. Then I woke up, {I swear it was just because of habit again} at 3:45, I fell right back asleep. I finally woke up at 5:50 a.m for good.

Wellbutrin,Depression,"""I am on day 3 of wellbutrin. I have a special 70mg doseage as in Europe not easily available. I did day 1 and day 2 on 35mg. I just slept all the time and thankfully was the weekend so off work. I felt so great though apart from being zombie. Was hungry alot too. Day 3 - I&#039;ve taken 35mg morning now my second 35mg at evening. Am wondering will the sleepiness go away? I&#039;ve tried loads of SSRI&#039;S and SRNI&#039;s and just sleep all the time on all of them. Very frustrating as I know lots of people who are on anti depressants and they don&#039;t have the zombie affect and it really improves the quality of their lives. Am probably going to have to come off anti depressants as no quality of life with the zombie affect. Any advice be appreciated. :("""
Chantix,Smoking Cessation,"""I have been smoke free for a little over a year. I used Chantix and experienced some side effects. I kind of manipulated my use of it and would take it every other day... that helped some. Once I had been without a cigarette for an entire week, I quit Chantix. The medicine really works and being smoke free is well worth the temporary side effects."""
Drospirenone / ethinyl estradiol / levomefolate calcium,Birth Control,"""I&#039;ve been on Beyaz for almost a month now. I really like it. So far I&#039;ve had no side effects. THATS GREAT. I was on two other birth controls and they made me gain weight and made my acne get ten times worse and did not help my cramps and I got badly depressed.

My depression due to FMS faded within two weeks of taking 10 mg of the generic ESCITALOPRAM, that was over a year ago. I still have to take pain medicine, but at least I can cope mind-wise with all the issues FM throws at us. I have a slight problem with loss of appetite, but didn&#039;t mind loosing 10 lbs. over time and stabilizing at a healthy weight. I&#039;ll never stop taking it!"""
Skyla,Birth Control,"""This is just about the insertion because I feel it&#039;s my duty to quell the fears of other women out there after I let myself go way overboard in reading horror stories online and freaking myself out... I was prepared for the worst pain of my life based on what everyone was saying, and I can&#039;t believe how completely fine it was. Seriously, I would describe it as discomfort. I squeezed the nurse&#039;s hand really hard for a second and then it was over. Barely had any cramping afterwards.

I know this isn&#039;t true for everyone, but it is probably way more likely that you will have an experience like mine, so don&#039;t freak out, please! It&#039;s a non-issue, don&#039;t waste energy getting stressed over this like I stupidly did."""
Naltrexone,Alcohol Dependence,"""Hello everyone, I am 24 years old and I became an alcoholic about 4 years ago. I became a bartender at a fancy restaurant and everything totally went south because of that. The place pays awfully well so I could never leave it at the time. It was so easy to get my hands on any booze I wanted from there. I found myself getting in bar fights and totalling my truck and a severe weight gain (60 pounds). When I drink its usually 7 doubles, 4 beers, and 3 shots of tequila in 2-3 hrs. I started naltrexone a month ago and I been sober since. I cannot believe that it lets me handle alcohol all night and not let me get cravings for it. I been waking up at 7am vs 12pm every morning now. This medicine really works, I feel great and have more $$"""
Relpax,Migraine,"""I&#039;m 20, and I&#039;ve had migraines since I was 6 years old. I had tried everything my doctor could think of before I went to a neurologist, and she suggested Relpax. I will never go back to any of the &quot;home remedies&quot; or any other medication as long as Relpax is on the market. I get visual blind spots when a migraine is setting in and I take it as soon as the spots appear, which is usually 10 minutes before the pain starts. Within 30 minutes, I&#039;m back to feeling great."""
Buspirone,Anxiety,"""I&#039;ve long used BuSpar, and it is an odd duck. Alone, it did little, but in combination with other meds it&#039;s amazing. Particularly SSRIs. It seems to amplify other meds, from painkillers to Prozac. It&#039;s not something I&#039;m afraid to take, the boost is subtle but it definitely helps my anxiety slip away. I&#039;ve not noticed any sick withdrawal efffects, being off it once for 2 months. I take 30 mg/day in two 15 mg doses."""
Dapagliflozin,"Diabetes, Type 2","""So far probably the most effective rx I ever taken. In 25 days my a1c has dropped from near 10 to6.5 and the only thing I think I have experienced wrong is some constapation but not terrible. Still in the early stages but if it stays on track-God send."""
Prozac,Anxiety and Stress,"""Been on this for a few weeks now and I feel no better than I did before I started taking this.. Gained weight and getting severe migraines.."""
Mirena,Birth Control,"""Literally have never been in so much pain in my life. After what felt like 20 minutes (it was probably two) she asked me to calm down...right then and there I said stop. Nope. I absolutely can not calm down if another thing is inserted onto or into my cervix.

Did not successfully insert. 

I&#039;m definitely just getting my tubes tied, hormones are super awful anyways.

PS I have a high pain tolerance, this was a super anomaly for me."""
Acetaminophen / oxycodone,Pain,"""I have Epididimitis- the doctor put me on Percocet 5/325 1 tablet every 6 hrs. If you have ever had this kind of pain it hurts. Percocet didn&#039;t help. I have an upcoming knee surgery in December and my surgeon usually prescribes Percocet. I have taken Lortab for months for my knee and its effectiveness has worn out. """
Imitrex,Migraine,"""My doctor gave me a sample of Imitrex when it first came out. It was a MIRACLE drug for me. Up to that time, nothing I took helped the headaches I got. I&#039;ve used it since. Over time, my headaches have gotten less - maybe with age?? But I keep it with me all the time just in case. I &quot;don&#039;t leave home without it.&quot;!"""
Amoxicillin / clavulanate,Sinusitis,"""Pro: Got relief from bad sinus infection within one day

Concerta,ADHD,"""I was first diagnosed with ADD when I was 6 years old, I&#039;m almost 28 now,and have been on Ritilan and Adderall for most of my life. I went off medication a few times in my life and although I was functional, I found myself spacing out a lot, and unable to focus. Recently I had been under so much stress that I was experiencing more frequent zoning out especially at work. So I talked to my doctor about it, and he originally prescribed Strattera but my insurance company wouldn&#039;t cover it so he put me on 20 mg dose once a day. This is only my second day on it, but overall I&#039;ve had little negative side effects. Just a minor loss of appetite and some dry mouth. I am definitely feeling a lot more focused and can still sleep. So far so good."""
Anastrozole,Breast Cance,"""Have been taking Arimidex for 3 years after double mastectomy for stage 1 invasive ductal carcinoma breast cancer.

Went off meds for about 2 weeks but no change. Want to go off completely but afraid of cancer returning. Have had melanoma on my back and hand. Also have lymphedema in both arms &amp; chest.

Metronidazole,Bacterial Infection,"""I was prescribed the 500mg pills for 10 days to fight some sort of bacteria infection in my stomach. I am on day 6 and have had zero issues with these meds until today. I took one of the pills without eating anything with it(I have always taken the meds with food previously)and felt as if I was going to die about 30 minutes later. Serious cramping, nausea, headache, and a sudden franticness overcame me and all I could do was sit down in the subway line I was in. Fortunetly, I forced myself to eat a bag of chips and chugged a 32 ouch tea and found relief within 10 minutes. Needless to say, making sure you eat with this prescription is strongly advised. As for the job, it eradicated the infection and showed improvements a day after treatment"""
Benicar,High Blood Pressure,"""Not compatible with moderate alcohol. I haven&#039;t had a hangover in over 10 years. After two pills, I had a doozy."""

Then woke up 2 hours later with the cramping again! So Yes this stuff works!

Ethinyl estradiol / norethindrone,Birth Control,"""This is the third birth control I have tried and I have no complaints whatsoever! I&#039;ve been on it for a little over a year now. It has the lowest dosage of artificial hormones, doesn&#039;t make me gain weight or have crazy mood swings. The only things I have noticed while taking it is occasionally a low sex drive, which is honestly not a problem unless you want to feel sexy 24/7, which, let&#039;s face it, is just not for everyone. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is starting out on birth control for the first time or is looking for an alternative. It&#039;s gentle, it&#039;s not conflicting with my lifestyle and I have my period regularly without any spotting. Everyone&#039;s body is different, so definitely ask your OBGYN. Hope this helps!"""
Methadone,Opiate Withdrawal,"""I am a 39 year old female who has been taking 120 mg of methadone daily to help with opiate addiction. I was addicted to opiates for 8 years after having several different surgeries over a 5 year span. My addiction took over my life I was doing things I&#039;d never otherwise have done to support my habit eventually losing custody of my son which was my breaking point. I found a local methadone clinic and it saved my life and I got custody of my son back within the first two months of starting methadone treatment. The downside is the 80 lbs I&#039;ve gained and the loss of several teeth but honestly that&#039;s a small price to pay to be off the horrible rollercoaster ride that drug addiction becomes. I thank God every day for this second Chance at life."""
Guaifenesin / pseudoephedrine,Cough and Nasal Congestion,"""I have to say, I wish I read this blog beforehand. I took a Mucinex D at 7pm last night and it&#039;s 9:30 am, I haven&#039;t really gone to sleep. I tried to fall asleep around 11pm, and after 2 1/2 hours of tossing and turning and CRAZY dreams where I wasn&#039;t really asleep but wasn&#039;t completely awake either, I got up and watched some T.V to get my mind to settle down. Needless to say, I was never tired after that so I&#039;ve been up since. I noticed several people saying that you should only take one pill. The back of my box says to take 2 pills every 12 hours so I&#039;m assuming there are two different types. Just beware....not only did it give me insomnia, but the dreams were seriously weird."""
Varenicline,Smoking Cessation,"""I quit smoking 12/7/2007 while using Chantix. I have not touched a cigarette since.  I do not crave cigarettes.  I do not think about them. I tried everything around to quit but not until Chantix did it take. I love the freedom from not worrying if I have enough cigarettes and I can&#039;t imagine the cost of it now. I remember it caused some nausea and vivid dreams. I wasn&#039;t a happy person while quitting but the end goal was so worth it. NO COUGH ANYMORE! I almost forgot about that annoying smoker&#039;s cough. It goes away. It really does. Wishing everyone good luck and good health."""

I used it for the first 3 days and since then I use it about twice a month in the winter and once a week in the summer. I live in Florida..it works. I was a wet bucket before."""

Wasn&#039;t on any birthcontrol before hand. I started my period about 28-30 days a normal cycle after the initial insertion of the implant. I bruised a little bit but nothing major.

Had yeast infection the fist month and bad vaginal itch but it was controlled after I wash 3 times a day or wash when I start itching. So far I lost 20lbs.

Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""Reduces heavy menstrual bleeding by an average of 90% after the first few months of use.
Reduces menstrual bleeding and cramps and, in many women, eventually causes menstrual periods to stop altogether. In this case, not menstruating is not harmful.

Restasis,Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca,"""I was prescribed Restasis by my ophthalmologist due to severe dry eye caused by Accutune. I was given a card that gave me a discount since I did not have private health insurance and used each vile over 2-3 days so that it became effectively very cheap for me to use. I had side effects at first, burning eyes and blurred vision. I was told it takes a minimum of 3 months to see any benefits so I kept using it. It worked almost too well, as my eyes started producing tears so much that my eyes would water all the time. I stopped using the product after 1 year, and my eyes have improved so much I no longer need to use it, although I still use regular over the counter eye drops (Systane Balance) once or twice a day as needed"""
Duloxetine,Depression,"""I&#039;m 21. Cymbalta works really well with depression. It made me happy. So happy I could lose my mind in myself and forget to do anything but eat and think.

I&#039;m not going to gain all my weight back to make myself more depressed in the future. Watch out for this one if you&#039;re watching what you eat.

Nexplanon,Birth Control,"""I just got my nexplanon out today and begin taking Yaz on Sunday. My implant was great in the fact that it did its job- I had no pregnancy scares with my boyfriend and felt relieved that I won&#039;t be needing to buy any pregnancy tests for scares. However- I had SEVERE weight gain. 50 pounds to be exact over the course of 2 and a half years. After the holidays I decided to make a change because I was just not happy with myself. I also didn&#039;t have my period... I was on it the day of insertion and maybe 2 days later.... But that was it. I didn&#039;t have a period for 2 and a half years. My doctor said this is why she doesn&#039;t recommend the implant, and says the pill is generally a better way to go.

Tioconazole,Vaginal Yeast Infection,"""I always read reviews but for some reason I didn&#039;t this time.  I wish I had. This stuff it horrible, it should be taken off the market.

I&#039;m also a calmer, less anxious version of myself, more patient mother. Things don&#039;t seem to bother me as much! My head is quiet. For side effects the first 2 days were bad - chills, tingling/current sensation on my scalp, upper back and neck and numb arms, drowsy. My doctor told me not to quit, so glad I did! No constipation or trouble urinating. Still get occasional chills and scalp tingling, low appetite (good cause I was overeating!). Hope it lasts!"""
Metronidazole,Bacterial Vaginitis,"""The medicine works. But of course the after taste is the worst. It leaves a horrible taste on your tongue that alters the taste of everything you eat.

Just have to get over the after taste and nausea. And water doesn&#039;t necessarily help."""

Before, I had panic attacks just thinking about breakfast, but now it seams as though life is so much easier. I can breathe and I feel well, where as before I felt just a constant struggle. In my case, the physical symptoms of anxiety where ruining my life and I felt a constant hyperventilation. With the symptoms gone, I can now really experience things. """
Contrave,Weight Loss,"""This is day three for me taking Contrave.  I was really excited to start the med because I knew it was closely related to Wellbutrin.  Years ago I took Wellbutrin to stop smoking and it work great.  So day 1 I weighed 197lb and I&#039;m 5-3.  Felt kind of fuzzy and in the later afternoon a bit nauseous.  Day 2 after sleeping great woke up and took morning med and shortly later felt nauseous but not bad enough to quit.  Absolutely no appetite, had cereal and beef stick for lunch.  Evening dinner was a half of a small steak and green beans.  Woke up with stomach cramps and diarrhea, had 3 bouts.  I attribute it to the high fatty foods I ate.  Weigh in again on the 4/24/17.   Dr. gave me free month supply so I will try it before I buy it."""
Chateal,Birth Control,"""I&#039;ve had a great experience on Chateal. I used to have terrible migraines and unbearable cramps that on more than one occasion threatened to send me to the ER (and only didn&#039;t because I couldn&#039;t stand up and walk to the car to get there), and that all stopped when I got on birth control. I started on Levora and switched to Chanteal, the transition was seamless. I haven&#039;t had any of my previous problems and...it just works. If you are the kind of person who is able to take your pill at the same time each day (and really be consistent), then I would absolutely suggest this pill."""
Lo Loestrin Fe,Birth Control,"""When I started taking Lo Loestrin Fe it was great. It cleared up my skin, I didn&#039;t get pregnant, I didn&#039;t have any periods, it was AWESOME. About 3 months into it I started seeing a major decrease in my sex drive, I was extremely moody and depressed, my husband and I fought pretty much on a daily basis... needless to say I stopped taking it after my annual prescription ran out. I only took it because our insurance covered the entire cost. But after seeing the effects it had on, not just me but, my marriage, I refuse to ever take this medication again. I HATE this birth control and I wouldn&#039;t recommend anyone taking it."""
Clonidine,Hypertensive Emergency,"""I now know how a baloon feels when it is deflated. I went to ER with 195/145.

3 months after it being inserted I I had very heavy periods that lasted for 14-16 days at a time every 5 days with major clotting. My doctor put me on the Pill as well as Implanon because he thought it may help settle my hormones down. After a month of being on the Pill the bleeding stopped and went back to normal. My skin has always been fairly clear, however, ever since Implanon has taken effect I have found my skin has gotten worse and worse. Lastly, I cannot sleep on my arm without it hurting and my arm hurts even when i don&#039;t touch it."""

I never had any trouble with the side effects so it worked out well for me."""
Wellbutrin,Depression,"""I have been on 150XL  and feel horrible. Its almost like I&#039;m tripping on LSD. Foggy head, angry, cranky and very irritable.

The next day I was groggy, dizzy, foggy head, dry nose, dry throat and mouth. The dryness was so bad my nose and throat actually ached and had a stinging sensation. The grogginess and extreme dizziness got worse as the day went on.  I will never take this drug again even in a smaller dose.

Emtricitabine / tenofovir,HIV Infection,"""After one year on Truvada in combination with Prezista and Norvir - the only listed side effect I may be suffering from is insomnia - and I think that has more to do with other factors than with Truvada (I take it at Noon).  After hearing about possible side effects with HIV medicines- it is a pleasant surprise!"""
Doxycycline,Acne,"""The pill worked within a month. I stopped taking it and my acne came back so I&#039;m back on the pill and now it&#039;s taking quite a bit of time to go away."""
Cephalexin,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,"""I had to take a double dosage of Keflex. I weigh about 115lbs and had to take 500mg 4 times a day for 10 days. I didn&#039;t have any issues with side effects or drinking alcohol while on it. It was prescribed as a precaution after I accidentally got a cut on my leg that required 13 stitches. The only dissatisfactory attribute was the horrid sulfur smell of the capsules."""
Acetaminophen / hydrocodone,Pain,"""I&#039;ve had back pain for almost 3 years now, sometimes to the point of tears due to simple actions like walking or bending. After being put on this medication 3-4 doses daily, I have had the pain relieved, and my actual mood and focus has increased at work. My previous evaluations and reviews were below average and now after being put on this treatment my last two reviews have increased to above average. It takes effect quite quickly and lasts for the directed amount of time on the prescription. The only con I have for this medication is that it affects myself in a negative way during intercourse. I have found when on the medication my climax takes 3-4 times as long or not at all during that time. Quite frustrating."""
