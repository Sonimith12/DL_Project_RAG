Stadol,Labor Pain,"""I was put in the hospital a month before the delivery of my twins, and stadol worked great for contractions. It also helped me sleep a lot better."""
Ambien,Insomnia,"""I&#039;ve had horrible insomnia since I was a child. Diagnosed with severe sleep apnea a few years ago.  Ambien is not the holy grail.  You build up a tolerance over the years but 12.5 is as high as most doctors will go ) from 10, 8 years ago).  Pluses for Ambien - it will put you to sleep; no half-life so no grogginess in the morning.  Minuses- it will put you to sleep but generally not keep you asleep.  Thus the waking up wide awake at 3 a.m.  There is now intermezzo - and sublingual 3.5 dose of Ambien meant for  this problem - works for me 50% of the time- otherwise I just stay up.  Another minus - if you take Ambien on a full stomach IT WILL NOT WORK. I generally eat before 5 and allow 5 hours before I take it.  But in all - a savior!"""
Amitriptyline,Pain,"""I&#039;m 20 years old and have both fibromyalgia and rheumatoid arthritis. I also use amitriptyline to treat my depression and my sleep. Before my rheumatologist prescribed this, I went through numerous other things which all caused me to get horrible headaches, stomach problems, and did nothing for my depression. 

I sleep well pretty much every night and I dont wake up feeling groggy, I dont have as many &#039;bad body days&#039; anymore, and I feel way better emotionally."""
Tri-Sprintec,Birth Control,"""Been on this pill for 6 months now. Never had any problems like everyone else. I always had trouble with my periods; lasted 8 days, super heavy, sick when I started and bad cramps. Plus my period lasts only 4 days. The only side effects I have is light cramps and not as hungry anymore. I weighed 160lbs and now weigh 147lbs. I love this pill and will continue taking it."""
Diphenhydramine,Allergic Reactions,"""I have had allergy all my life, pretty severe and I live in allergy heaven in TX. I have tried Everything and for me, benedryl is still the best.
I work and it does not effect me, I often take it several times a day."""
Ziprasidone,Bipolar Disorde,"""I&#039;ve taken it for only 3 days and a haff. It has positive affect for my bipolar. the 1st day I was so scared and wanted to give up because of drowsiness and tiress, nightmare (40mg mornig and 40mg afternoon). but after I cut the dose down (40mg/ night only)  everything&#039;s gone good. I&#039;ve got feelings of happiness which I&#039;ve lost for long time!!! I think it works for depression combine bibolar. but the problem that it make me difficuty to feel asleep. I coudn&#039;t sleep early, woke up until 2am!!! I&#039;m looking to see my doctor soon."""
St. john's wort,Depression,"""I am taking this along with Buspar for my anxiety and depression. I only had anxiety so I was only taking Buspar, but it seems as though Buspar took away the anxiety and brought on depression. I&#039;m against taking SSRI&#039;s or other antidepressants, so I asked my doctor first about possible interactions, then bought some St. John&#039;s Wort. Ever since, it hasn&#039;t happened to me anymore. I also have no side effects at all from it. Some people say it will give u headaches, but I&#039;ve never had one. I personally believe that if u truly need this, there will be no headaches because your body needs it. But who knows, that&#039;s just my personal opinion :) it doesn&#039;t hurt to try it!"""
BuSpar,Anxiety,"""I&#039;ve been taking 15 mg 2x/day with good results.  My social anxiety has improved and I am sleeping much better.  I have been taking Ambien almost every night for the past 4 years and now down to less than 1x/week.  That to me has made it worth it."""
Camrese,Birth Control,"""I am on the 3rd sheet of pills so about 3 months in... before taking i weighed 120 now I am 130... feel depressed, just this week started to get brown discharge and thick red blood clots, try to take the pill everyday with my coffee but I was an hour off a few times, my boobs grew from C to double DD I don&#039;t mind but I do feel bloated and have had a couple angry depressed days..not sure its worth these symptoms but before I had such bad cramps n migraines was in bed every month for 2 days at least. Plus I thought only being 29 having early menopause with hot flashes n migraines this would help me... not sure yet. Staying on for another week or soo see what happens and the weight gain for me is the worst I don&#039;t fit in my pants, plus need new bras."""
Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""I have had Skyla for about two months now. I have had spotting everyday, some light days and then experience some heavy days. It is really uncomfortable being on my period for two months now because I can&#039;t wear any of my cute undies and have to stay in these dreadful undies so my nice ones won&#039;t get ruined! As of right now, I hate my IUD. I wish I would have gotten the pill but I know I wouldn&#039;t remember taking it everyday. I hope in this next month the spotting and mild cramping goes away! Definitely going to call my doc and ask if it&#039;s normal to have your period for almost 2 months. Hope this helps some of you!!"""
Acetaminophen / oxycodone,Pain,"""I have chronic back pain.  I take this medication as needed.  This medicine has allowed me to go back to enjoying children, gardening, camping, etc.  I have small children so this medication really helps with pain while allowing me to be fully functional as well.  Doesn&#039;t make me loopy or nauseous.  This has been a wonder-drug for me."""
Iloperidone,Psychosis,"""Just recently started taking this for depression, bipolar, insomnia and anxiety. I feel so tired and groggy feeling."""
Victoza,"Diabetes, Type 2","""Didn&#039;t do bad on .06 the first week but still had a strong urge to eat. Had diarrhea and headaches. Then I started 1.2 two days ago and today I was so nauseated I prayed to vomit. Then I started vomiting and it won&#039;t stop. I take medication other than victoza every night at bedtime including metformin and a few minutes ago I threw up most of my pills from last night still intact but swollen. The food from 4 days ago smelled like roadkill. I fear how long it will be before someone dies of an overdose from old medication in their stomach not digesting in time for future doses. It&#039;s been more than 20 hours since I ingested anything but water and a vanilla breakfast shake. I will not be taking my regular meds tonight. Victoza is out!!!!!!"""
Levonorgestrel,Emergency Contraception,"""After reading so many reviews in the past couple of weeks, I felt I needed to write one given my unusual experience.  I had unprotected sex the first week of December, I took Plan B within 12hrs and felt completely fine.  4 days later I bled very heavily for 4 or 5 days, and figured I safe.  Then my period never came, took 2 pregnancy tests both were negative but I got so paranoid once I was a week late I went to the doctor and had a blood test, also negative, but with still no period and &quot;pregnancy symptoms&quot; I was still very concerned. FINALLY 11 days late I started my period.  Plan B can definitely throw your system very out of whack, so moral of the story if you&#039;re anything like me try and relax!"""
Oracea,Rosacea,"""Since I have used this medication so long, years and years, I believe it has improved my rosacea. I&#039;m not willing to stop taking Oracea to find out. As far as the stomach ache associated with this pill, I found that taking it at night prevents the stomach upset symptoms. One review mentioned burning on the lips and tongue, I have experienced this side effect very very much, however, I didn&#039;t realize this pill may be the reason. Again, if this pills causes the lips, mouth area and tongue to have a burning sensation I&#039;m not sure I would stop taking the Oracea, although that is one terrible side effect. Overall, I will continue taking Oracea."""
Ethinyl estradiol / norgestimate,Birth Control,"""I&#039;ve waited out the three month wait time of absolute hell. Since starting Tri Sprintec my anxiety is through the roof, which exacerbates my depression to the point of me having suicidal thoughts on a daily basis. I can&#039;t wait to see my doctor and switch to a new pill. At 25 yo my acne had subsided from the teenage years, but since I was started on Tri Sprintec it has come back. I thought maybe it would just come and go around the time of my period. Nope. Still here and even more coming in. I feel like I am back to being a teenager again with this acne and crazy mood swings. I am crying over anything and everything. Maybe these side effects will go away in more time but I can&#039;t handle this any longer to find out."""
Monistat 3-Day Combination Pack,Vaginal Yeast Infection,"""I read so many horrible reviews of this that I almost didn&#039;t try it. Fearing the excruciating pain described by such a majority of reviews, I tried natural remedies. I even tried the &quot;put a clove of garlic up your hooha&quot; method! None of the remedies worked.

This medication was a godsend. Please do not fear it. I experienced no pain with this, and it killed the infection dead within a day or two. I was amazed. Many people write about burning pain worse than childbirth, but I want to tell you that I experienced nothing like that. It was easy, painless, and, most importantly, extremely effective. Yeast infection is finallyour gone!"""
Venlafaxine,ibromyalgia,"""Been on this medicine for Fybromyalgia for 4 days and it has made a lot of difference already.  I am on the very low dose at the moment 37.5mg and am titrating up to 75mg after the first week. I feel sick in the morning before I eat (which I don&#039;t usually do until lunch time) but after a coffee this feeling subsides enough to manage.  I have tried about 6 other medicines over the past 12 months and the side effects of them all were intolerable.  However if I can take this medicine with the effect it has already had then I will be happy."""
Indomethacin,"Gout, Acute","""Wicked Apple was my poison( a fine ale!), after that in about 12 hours I began to hurt, and in 18 hours there was no relief in the pain.  I took my Colcrys (0.6) as prescribed, starting at 11pm, 12, and again at 2 am (about 15 hours after I had my one and only Wicked Apple)  20 hours later, it is all I can do to walk into the Dr&#039;s office still in terrible pain.  

The Dr gave me an injection of METHYLPRENISOLONE ACETATE (40mg) and prescribed Indomethacin.  By 22 hours I was feeling better, by 24 I was walking again, 26 hours I could stand in the shower.

It could have been the combination of the three drugs I have in my system, but 36 hours later, there is no pain and I only had one pill!  I still have swelling, but no pain!  Thank You!!"""
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""I have not gotten my period just like I haven&#039;t before which is why I decided to go on Nexplanon due to the pregnancy scares from not getting my period all the time. One thing that sucks about it is my sex drive, I don&#039;t get turned on easily and I&#039;m not  &quot;wet&quot; like I used to. I just got it about a month ago so hopefully nothing bad occurs besides that."""
Insulin isophane,Gestational Diabetes,"""I am terrified of needles and was very upset when I found out that I would have to give myself daily injections.  This pen is so easy to use.  I didn&#039;t even feel the needle.  I feel much better about the last ten weeks of my pregnancy."""
Armodafinil,Hypersomnia,"""I have anxiety/panic attacks and fibromyalgia. Fun! So, unfortunately I get sick with Lyrica at higher doses where it actually kills the fibromyalgia pain. After months of trial and errors, we&#039;ve finally found that 100mg of Pristiq, 20mg of Methadone, 225mg of Lyrica and 300mg of Tramadol is the only thing that will stop the pain. For the anxiety the Pristiq helps and also 3mg of Klonopin stops the panic (also took months of trial and error in addition to therapy). With this large amount of depressant style drugs, at times it was very hard for me to stay awake during the daytime. 150mg of Nuvigil for me has totally solved this problem. The first week I felt strange and over stimulated, and now I just feel normal and awake, from 6:00am to 10:30pm."""
Ethinyl estradiol / norethindrone,Birth Control,"""I would recommend this birth control to everyone. I have been taking it for almost two years. My periods are light and only last for a few days. My cramps are very tolerable. I don&#039;t feel unusually moody or irritable. My breasts did increase in size from a B32 to a D32. My skin is pretty clear, and I did not gain any weight. I would never switch to another birth control!"""
Gabapentin,ibromyalgia,"""Was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia at the start of the year having suffered with severe neck and upper back pain.  The deep pain especially in the upper back right in between the shoulder blades was unbearable most of the time.  I had the symptoms for over 2 years before the diagnosis and had almost 80 sessions of treatment with 11 different therapists. 

Anyway started taking duloxetine, gabapentin and Cocodamol in January.  Started gabapentin at 300 mg a day and built up to 1800mg a day by the end of March.  Over the last few weeks I feel that I am starting to get my life back.  Not totally pain free but I now have spells where the pain is bearable.  So if you have just started on this,  be patient and fingers crossed you will get relief."""
Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""I just got my second Mirena inserted today - I will seriously never do anything else.  I&#039;ve tried other methods (patch, NuvaRing, pill) and nothing compares to Mirena if you want longer-term birth control!

Yes, it is fairly painful upon insertion, but it lasts for only about 40 seconds max, but it is so worth it!  Both time I didn&#039;t have bleeding or cramping afterwards.  My first time I didn&#039;t even have spotting, my periods just completely stopped for all 5 years.  I am crossing my fingers for the same this time!  I never had weight gain and my skin was amazingly clear.  For those who are interested in low-maintenance, long-term birth control, I cannot recommend Mirena more!"""
Ambien,Insomnia,"""I began taking Ambien 15 years ago I stopped it while I was pregnant with my first child and then ended up going back on it from lack of sleep for so long. I took it again first time 6 1/2 years before becoming pregnant again and then had to stop it. When my youngest son was a year and a half old I started taking it again because I could not sleep longer than an hour.  When I first started taking Ambien I think the chemical compound was a different because back then I would eat in my sleep, cook meals in my sleep, but then after going off of it and going back on it I believe the formulation changed. I have not had any of those issues for over 13 years. Taking it on empty stomach makes a huge difference."""
Belviq,Weight Loss,"""Belviq simply killed my appetite, especially the urge I have to snack in the evening. I&#039;ve lost 14 lbs in almost 4 weeks and I&#039;m well on my way to lose 30 lbs. I sleep much better too. I don&#039;t know if that&#039;s from Belviq or less snacking in the evening but it is a fact."""
Levaquin,Pneumonia,"""This drug is GARBAGE and should be taken off the Market. I was hospitalized with pneumonia. The doctor prescribed it for me when I was released from the hospital. It has destroyed my appetite as well as my stomach. I can&#039;t sleep. I am nauseous every day. I have 2 more doses to take. I decided not to take them. I can&#039;t tolerate all the side effects."""
Suprep Bowel Prep Kit,Bowel Preparation,"""It tasted horrible. It did produce the expected outcome but I started vomiting and hour after each dose"""
Accutane,Acne,"""I&#039;ve had acne for about 8 years. Last year it suddenly deteriorated into severe nodular cystic acne. I started Accutane in September 2016, I&#039;m nearly finished my sixth month and I still have the same nodules and cysts that I had at beginning of the treatment, I&#039;m still breaking out the same as before. Accutane is effective for 96% of people whilst they&#039;re on it, so I&#039;m not bashing Accutane, it&#039;s an amazing drug for the majority of people. I&#039;m obviously an exception and I&#039;m devastated."""
Plan B,Emergency Contraception,"""I had unprotected intercourse twice within the range of the 72 hours. I asked a friend of mine who has used Plan B and the morning after I purchased Plan B for $41.80 (price is after taxes). Came home, took them, felt fine. No side effects. I was supposed to get my period 3 days later but I didn&#039;t. I got minor cramps here and there but nothing too severe. Now exactly a week after I took them I got my period (5 days late). This pill works but I never ever get severe period cramps. My period cramps this time are very severe and painful to the point where I can barely move. This has never happened to me before and I hope it lightens up in the next couple of days."""
Bupropion / naltrexone,Obesity,"""I have been on CONTRAVE now for 6 months I think.
Working but not as potent as in the beginning.
Exercising moderately as well.

It was covered by my insurance but no more. I have lost 31 lbs.
Still,I can&#039;t stay on this med forever.
Very expensive when paid out-of-pocket.
I will try it one more month and then get off it.
Side effects are still some dizziness and  intermittent nausea."""
Contrave,Obesity,"""I started march 18 slight headache but it sure did curb my appetite.I wasn&#039;t hungry but i sure thought n talked about food n soda how I want to indulge but didnt ,couldnt contrave wouldn&#039;t let me.Until this evening I was doing well I was on a no carb low fat until I ate a sandwich, feeling guilty. But you know  what I didnt binge I didn&#039;t even drink that ice cold pepsi I kind of feel good Maybe my body needed the sandwich .Its way less food I&#039;ve been eating I do recommend contrave. Week 2 soon I will keep you inform . I also had a gastric bypass and gained 40 lbs back. But now I&#039;m on my way to good health"""
Xyrem,Narcolepsy,"""When taken as prescribed medications works well for restful sleep."""
Cephalexin,Bacterial Infection,"""I use the Cephalexin to treat the absessed teeth i have.  I have used it before with UTI&#039;s.  I am allergice to PCN and my doctor perscribed the Cephalexin said that people that is allergic to the PCN can take the Cephalexin and it does the same job as PCN does."""
Depo-Provera,Birth Control,"""In the beginning I had bad headaches, vomiting &amp; non stop periods. Now after 12 months of this the only issue is weight gain. But having a small stomach I only gained 5 pounds. I have gained and lost (w/o exercising). I would say this is really effective but with side effects not so much. I went to see my doctor about my periods last time I went in she said if it doesn&#039;t stop after this cycle I should change birth controls. And is has she was right! If you think you will stop your periods so soon stop assuming and give depo a try! Its super effective and I&#039;ll definitely continue using it!"""
Relpax,Migraine,"""Relpax 40 mg is my go-to medication when I have a bad migraine.  I have tried almost all triptans, and this works best for me.  If taken ASAP, it typically zaps my migraine within 60-90 mins.

Relpax makes me feel spacey, &ldquo;floaty&rdquo; and tired so I usually take it and then lay down for a nap.  The side effects disappear within an hour or two.  This seems to be stronger than Imitrex (sumatriptan) or Maxalt (rizatriptan).  Not sure if it is actually stronger or just works better for me.  It is quite expensive, even with insurance."""
Skyla,Birth Control,"""I got the Skyla inserted a week ago and it was pretty rough. The actual process of getting it in did not bother me but after I had awful cramps, felt nauseous and lightheaded. The cramps have not gone away but have lightened a little bit. The doctor said I was feeling pain because I have a &quot;sensitive uterus&quot; and have never had kids. Haven&#039;t bled at all though which is nice."""
Glatiramer,Multiple Sclerosis,"""I was diagnosed July 2012.  Finally!  I could no longer walk, my legs had gotten so weak.  Was in a wheelchair already.  PPMS is not fun.  I have noticed that my legs are stronger, but still not able to walk.  And my MS has not gotten any worse.  Don&#039;t have and have never had &quot;flare ups&quot; but at the rate I was going downhill before Copaxone, this is great.  I don&#039;t like the shots, but I know they are worth it."""
Miconazole,Vaginal Yeast Infection,"""HORRIBLE
This product should be recalled
I&#039;ve used it before with no issues but this time around---- are the ingredients different ?? EXTREME BURNING AND ITCHING!!
I should have waited to see a doc and take a pill !!!!! It&#039;s almost 1 am and I can&#039;t sleep :((("""
Levonorgestrel,Emergency Contraception,"""I took Next Choice about 4 hours after having unprotected sex with my husband. I also followed another users advice and took Dramamine about an hour before I took the pill in order to combat any nausea. After taking the pill I only felt slight amount of nausea, but it sure did wipe me out. I took the pill on a Sunday and slept all the way until Monday evening. Some side effects that I got were: major bloating, abdominal cramping for more than a week, slight headache, extreme fatigue, very heavy menstrual flow 4 days after taking the pill, mood swings, extreme hunger, breast tenderness, swollen ankles.... but other than the many side effects experienced, I am satisfied with this medication for preventing an unwanted pregnancy."""
Desvenlafaxine,Anxiety,"""I have been on Pristiq for 11 days after switching from Paxil 12.5 CR.  I feel like I&#039;ve been on a roller coaster ride.  Agitation, shaky, anxiety and emotional. The nausea and headaches are gone now but I&#039;m thinking this is not the right medicine for me.  I will give it 14 days and if there is no improvement I will get off them. Not sure what I&#039;ll try next. The doctor thinks Wellbutrin. """
Trulicity,"Diabetes, Type 2","""Just took my 8th injection of .75 Trulicity today.  It has been amazing.  I always had trouble with my sugars and would get horrible welts from Levemir.  Doctor switched me from Levemir to Tresiba (62 units each morning) and the difference has been amazing.  I have GERD so all I can report is that it definitely has not been worse.  My sugars used to run around 230 to 323 most of the time.  Now they are from about 65 to 130.  If I&#039;m under 80, I don&#039;t take any short-acting, which is Novolog for me.  I&#039;ve lost about 7 pounds and my cravings are a thing of the past.  I am on SSDI and with prior-authorization from my endocrinologist, Medicare has authorized payment.  If it ever doesn&#039;t, Trulicity and I will part ways."""
Drixoral Cold and Allergy,Sinus Symptoms,"""Drixoral worked. Nothing in the drug store works like drixoral did.  I&#039;m tired of trying different brands to find what works because nothing does.  If there is such a demand for it to come back then bring it back in its original potency but have it be prescription only PLUS patients must have a documented chronic sinus condition"""
Adipex-P,Weight Loss,"""I started taking this medicine 03/08/10 at 215lbs..today is 04/14/10 and I am at 195lbs! Total loss of 20lbs in a little over a month.  I have been watching my calorie intake around  1000-1200 a day...and exercise at least 4-5 times a week (30-45 minutes each workout). During Easter I ate Easter dinner with the family and believe in having what I call my &quot;cheat day&quot; once a week.  I avoid fast food @ all cost excluding Subway and Wendy&#039;s where I can eat delicious low fat/low calorie food. One of my biggest weaknesses is sweet tea...I have switched from regular sugar to Splenda and I have adjusted well to the change. This medicine works, it helps me keep focused on my goal..30-40 more lbs to go!"""
Doxycycline,Acne,"""I took doxycycline for one month exactly and it honestly did my face wonders! My doctor had it combined with 3%/5% benzamycin top gel, but I managed to finish the gel in 2 weeks or less because my break outs were bad and that would make them go away by the next day. Now the doxycycline has helped A LOT with the break outs not appearing on my face. I&#039;m 20 years old and got the pills prescribed to be taken once a day every day for a month and now I haven&#039;t broken out since I started. I&#039;m a girl and whenever I got my period, I would break out pretty badly, but this medication has helped A LOT with that. I will ask for a refill on both medications. Highly recommend to give them both a try."""
Victoza,"Diabetes, Type 2","""My doctor suggested victoza. The biggest side effects are constipation and upset stomach.  I burp and have gas a lot. My appetite is gone and I can&#039;t eat as much. I fill up quickly. I have only lost a few pounds but I am only 17 pounds overweight. I will stick with it. My fasting sugar numbers have been between 100 and 115. I will stick with it."""
Duloxetine,Depression,"""I am 20 years old. I was struggling with anxiety and depression for several years. Both peaked my junior year of college and I found it too much to bear. I went to my family doctor and he prescribed me 30 mg duloxetine. It changed my life in the most positive way. Before I started taking it, I would wake up every morning nauseous from anxiety. I was never at ease, I had the worst self confidence and thoughts of suicide. I was dreading my future. Now, my quality of life has greatly improved. I get excited when I think of what my life will bring. I wake up, and I live life. Things aren&#039;t perfect but compared to where I was 6 months ago, they are incredible. I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s for everyone, but it worked for me and I am so grateful."""
Plan B,Emergency Contraception,"""I had unprotected sex August 29 which was a Monday and after we finished he told me that he came inside me, and let me tell y&#039;all I was fertile and i ovulated on Wednesday!! Well I started freaking out and took the pill 40 min after. Tuesday morning I did feel some of the side effects but nothing too major!! Your period is either going to be early or late but i wasn&#039;t supposed to get my period until 2 weeks from the day I had sex. Fortunately I got it early six days later so it does work!! Also they say that if you weigh more then 160 or so it won&#039;t be as effective and well I&#039;m a pretty curvy girl I weigh 250 and it worked on me so Don&#039;t believe that stupid theory!!! Hope it was helpful!!"""
Rizatriptan,Migraine,"""Fantastic drug!  Works every time within half an hour.  Feel a little strange for around 30 minutes after taking it, but no other side effects.  Highly recommend it as it&#039;s the only thing that works for my migraines"""
Lexapro,Depression,"""I have been on Lexapro for a little over a month now. I immediately saw a change in my engery level. I got the motivation to get out of bed and be active again. My temper has subsided a lot. I used to cry a lot and I have not cried in weeks. I actually stop and think prior to showing anger. It has helped so much. I have not seen any fluctuation in weight. I have been sleeping more soundly. This is the first medication I have been put on for this medication and it seems to be working great."""
Desvenlafaxine,Depression,"""I&#039;m 20 years old and just started Pristiq 4 days ago. First time on antidepressants and I noticed a change immediately! I can actually enjoy my days and not cry excessively or get as many anxiety attacks. The only side effects I have are nausea and loss of appetite. But I highly recommend it!"""
Pramoxine,Hemorrhoids,"""I&#039;m in my early 30&#039;s and I have been suffering from hemorrhoids for 3 years now.  I have had multiple flares with a few visits to the ER. I have used few hemorrhoid medications and nothing has helped as much as Proctofoam. I feel the pressure go down, itchiness and size of the veins shrink within minutes. I highly recommend it. Thumbs up."""
Phentermine / topiramate,Weight Loss,"""I started about 6 weeks ago. I have list 13lbs so far. No side effects.  I will keep at as long as its working."""
Bactrim,Acne,"""I&#039;m a teen with pretty bad acne. Within two weeks my skin had cleared up tremendously. Unfortunately, then I started getting red hives all over my body due to a allergic reaction."""
Paxil,Anxiety and Stress,"""This med works great I had a lot of anxiety and hard time dealing with work, kids and my wife. I am totally in control now and can deal with a lot more issues at once...great results"""
Lorazepam,Anxiety,"""Please, as a human being to others, DO NOT ABRUPTLY STOP TAKING THIS MEDICATION! Only after one month on this medication, I quit it and went through living HELL on earth! This is a very serious medication. God Bless."""
Lamotrigine,Depression,"""Wow what a difference. I&#039;ve tried 4 SSRIs, 1 SNRI, Wellbutrin (Made me irritable and couldn&#039;t sleep), Viibryd, different ADHD stimulants, and the list goes on.

Currently, I&#039;m on sertraline (Zoloft generic) 100mg and it was working out okay, but still struggled with my temper and depression. After 5 weeks, I&#039;m finally on lamotrigine (Lamictal generic) IR 100mg once a day. It took 3 days after I started the 100mg to notice a big difference in my behavior. Side effects you might notice while starting it are Dizziness (minor), slight sedation or tiredness, and depression. My depression is now gone. I believe it was my brain adjusting to this miracle of a medication."""
Alprazolam,Tinnitus,"""I have moderately severe sensorineural hearing loss. Xanax alleviated my tinnitus a great deal for a couple years. After that, I reached tolerance to Xanax and it was no longer effective. What&#039;s more, unless I increased the dose, the tinnitus was louder than ever. Because of tolerance, I was having withdrawal symptoms between doses. Since tapering off and discontinuing Xanax, I have been out of my mind with anxiety and loud hissing tinnitus. These will subside as my brain recovers from the damage the drug has caused. Please educate yourselves about benzodiazepines. Don&#039;t rely on your doctor because most of them are recklessly uneducated about the dangers of benzos.  0.5 mg. of Xanax is not a low dose; it is roughly equal to 10mg of Valium."""
Ethinyl estradiol / levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""Although I only started this medication recently, I wanted to share my experience. I finally made the decision to start the pill because my last period was over two weeks late. After ruling out pregnancy, I discovered that I have a genetic history of ovarian cysts, which are lessened in frequency by birth control. I have also suffered from moderately severe periods, with cramps that made it impossible to go to work or school. I have just completed my first week of Aviane. I have had no nausea and perhaps a slight change in appetite where I eat a little more. What surprised me is that my breasts have grown about a third of a cup size. (This is a pleasant surprise for me, as I am a medium B-cup)."""
Bupropion / naltrexone,Obesity,"""This is my 4th week with full doses 2 in the morning and 2 in the evening. I am very honest in this feedback, my first week I took I don&#039;t have any side effect but when I get to my 3rd day, I experience migraine headache, which only last me half of that day and I feel fine. The most effective I&#039;ve noticed is that I don&#039;t even want to drink no more, (liquor,wine,beer etc) that was on week one.  I used to drink here and there when I am at home but now I am completely off from alcohol.
Now that this is my 4th complete week of full dose, yesterday 2/17/17 ( I&#039;ve experience nausea after I had my coffee then I threw up , just feeling sick and weak. Today I feel the same but not the nausea kind only little restless.  It&#039;s my 4th week I quit coffee"""
Lamisil,Tinea Capitis,"""I&#039;ve been taking the Terbinafine 250mg tab once daily for just over a month now and haven&#039;t had any noticeable side effects.  My toenails have cleared up considerably and I still have 60 more days of treatment.  I think if you take this medication as directed, with a full glass of water and do not drink alcohol excessively, you&#039;ll probably stand a better chance of complete success.  This is the first treatment I have tried since they took the Lamisil Cream off the market that has worked."""
Metronidazole,Diverticulitis,"""All I know is that 2 days into this course of treatment with flagyl and cipro, my horrible left lower quadrant pain is gone. I do feel a little down and lethargic but who cares? I&#039;m able to get some things done and get through a day at work. I do have a little headache and another medicine Amitiza seems to give me congestion in my head but it helped relax the colon spasms. I am so grateful though because I was in horrible pain for so long and didn&#039;t know why."""
Vardenafil,Erectile Dysfunction,"""Solid erection and great sex, but didn&#039;t get erection for hours afterwards (unlike Viagra). Side effects the next day were - tummy upset and headache/nausea. I guess I have to be careful - I had a few drinks beforehand (will need to cut that out). I also suffer from low blood pressure."""
Tramadol,Back Pain,"""I&#039;m only 26 years old and have been suffering from chronic back pain for 6 years (due to a fall). I haven&#039;t gotten much help from all the doctors I&#039;ve had. They all treated me like an addict because I&#039;m so young. Anyway my new doctor has given 50mg of Ultram but only 15 day supply. I wish I could have it everyday but the risk of addiction is not worth it. I&#039;m am super grateful I get 15 days of relief a month. It has helped me be my happy go lucky self. I recommend it."""
Magnesium sulfate / potassium sulfate / sodium sulfate,Bowel Preparation,"""First time using this prep and it does work much better than others. It is the most disgusting, fowl tasting thing I&#039;ve ever had. If I have to use it again I may try some of the tips I&#039;ve seen here like the lemons.  After getting 1st dose down it took about 45 mins to start.  The second dose was the hardest to get down.  I guess because I knew how bad it was going to be.  Almost didn&#039;t keep it down.  Drinking this and the 32 oz of water in an hour makes you bloated for sure.  I did get a headache but that may have come from being dehydrated which I was by the time I got to my appointment."""
Epiduo,Acne,"""I have used epiduo for about 2 years, maybe going on three. or about 2 months after beginning the use of this product my skin was really breaking out terribly (because it is a retnoid: it brings everything to the surface making your skin break out a lot, but is good in the long run). Then around week 10 my skin cleared up and was actually looking pretty good. However, this past summer, my skin broke out terribly like it had the first time i used it, and has not exactly cleared up since. I still have breakouts (although not as bad) on my cheekbones, forehead, and chin."""
Copper,Birth Control,"""In the past I have had serious problems when it comes to hormones after being on the pill for 3 months I developed anxiety and panic attacks, this was unusual considering I&#039;m a public speaker and have had no problems with standing in front of a crowd. I had the copper coil inserted in March and I have read that the procedure should only take 2 mins really... I was unlucky by having a trainee nurse who took 4 attempts and who had actually left the job half done. I spent 4 hours in A&amp;E last night trying to figure out why I was in so much agony. And as you do, I tried to to see if I could feel anything unusual... Surprise surprise the coil had dropped down and the wire was I fact 3cm away from the entrance of my vagina!"""
Hyaluronan,Osteoarthritis,"""Had my first injection today. No big deal at all. After reading all kinds of reviews I was anticipating a rough experience. In and out of the office in  20 minutes then off to work."""
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""I got this birth control inserted in April 2010 as I was in a long term relationship and taking the oral pill but was very forgetful in taking it. Implanon was recommended by a friend who I trusted very much so I did no research and took her word for it!! I have to say I have never looked back since. After reading the side effects I can honestly say I&#039;ve never had any! I get the usual monthly trouble i.e. headaches and cramps but nothing compared to what I would be use to. I do get my period every month like clock work to the day to the hour which I find very reassuring. I also have a very healthy sex life with my partner and have had not experienced weight gain in fact I have lost 3 stone on a healthy diet since it was put in."""
Bupropion / naltrexone,Obesity,"""My experience has been a good one. I am on week two and I have lost 10 pounds. It has taken away all my cravings and I dont eat in between meals anymore. I have not had any of the side effects they talk about except for an ever so slight headache at times. I contributed that to caffeine withdrawal.  I have also stuck to eating healthy and cut out alcohol. This has definitely been a good change for me."""
Leuprolide,Endometriosis,"""I did a 6 month treatment of Lupron and It wasn&#039;t that bad. The first couple of months I experienced migraines &amp; hot flashes. For the reminder or the treatment, I continued to experience the hot flases but my mood swings became very uncomfortable for my family, friends, &amp; me. I would one minute be calm &amp; neutral...the next minute I would become mean &amp; hateful. That was never how I was prior to the treatment. However, I completed my treatment in August 2009 and I haven&#039;t had any problems with my endometriosis at all. My doctor has now given me the option to either get pregnant or continue with birth control pills until I decide to become pregnant to maintain the endometriosis. I highly recommend this method if you can withstand the side effects."""
Amphetamine / dextroamphetamine,ADHD,"""I liked how focused it made me however if I was agitated it made it worse"""

It would be good if ins covered..this is a REAL DEBILITATING ISSUE! I wish they new what causes IBS and I pray this med cont to work!☺"""
Copper,Birth Control,"""When I was first considering birth control I chose this one because it was more reliable and long term. I am only 18 and am not looking to have a baby any time soon, so I thought it would be a good idea. The insertion was painful, but it only lasted for a minute or 2. After, it was uncomfortable and the cramps were so bad. But I didn&#039;t mind since my usual periods consist of painful cramps. I did a follow up 6 weeks later and everything was good. My periods are longer now, but only by 3 or 4 more days. I get some pains here and there and spotting at random times. The only thing that&#039;s difficult is checking the strings. But overall a great choice, no more pregnancy scares. I forget it&#039;s even there sometimes which is great"""
Exemestane,Breast Cance,"""This drug was the worst by far. Diagnosed almost 9 years ago in 2008. On tamoxifen for two years-had a hysterectomy-on Arimidex for five years. I thought after seven years I would not have to take anything. Dr said new research and I should take a drug for 10 years. Didn&#039;t want to go back on Arimidex because of the horrible side effects. On tamoxifen again for one year and developed a vetreous detachment in my eye-after research on my part could&#039;ve been linked to the tamoxifen. I went off that and started taking Exemestane. On for three weeks and had terrible backache, nausea, acid reflux, cracking bones, and horrible depression.  I won&#039;t take it again for only a 2% increase in survival"""
Fluconazole,Vaginal Yeast Infection,"""This was my first yeast infection. The pill worked really well and felt immediate relief. Had vomiting the next day and nausea which is apparently a rare side effect.. but it got the job done."""
Medroxyprogesterone,Birth Control,"""I took the depo shot twice, one shot every 3 months, right after highschool. While I did not get pregnant i gained 50 pounds. I had always been a tiny person. I was 100 pounds when I graduated and after that 6 months I was 150. No change in diet and I was actually more active. AFTER I decided to get off of it I was unable to lose the weight and I didn&#039;t get my period for 9 months and was not abe to get pregnant for a year and 9 months, which actually was failed (blighted ovum) and I finally am pregnant 2 and a half years later. All from 2 shots. My whole life I had very regular light periods.  After the shot they were random and fluctuated in flow from heavy to only spotting.  I would never recommend this birth control."""
Tapentadol,Pain,"""Nucynta has worked very well for all my aches and pain, from the most severe to those I didn&#039;t even know I had.  At first, it did make me groggy which was a problem, but I kept taking it anyway because it did take away most of my pain.  After a couple of months of use, it takes away my pain, just like it did at the beginning, but I no longer feel sleepy.  I feel energetic, happier and am able very active because I hardly feel any pain.  I highly recommend it, but you do have to give it a chance because once your body adapts to it, the adverse effects far outweigh the benefits."""

Loteprednol / tobramycin,"Conjunctivitis, Bacterial","""Works Like A Miracle! Quick Pain and Redness Relief!"""
Lorcaserin,Weight Loss,"""I started taking Belviq about 3 weeks ago after my doctor recommended I lose weight. I have to admit the first week I was starving while taking Belviq. I also started the paleo diet and increased my water to 84oz a day. (most days..lol) and 20 min of activity 5-6 days a week. I lost 3lbs the first week. I have continued to lose weight due to the combination of the low carb and the Belviq. I do not feel it is suppressing my appetite but I believe it is assisting in my weight loss. I seem to be burning more calories and I rarely have cravings. I do have a one carb treat once a week to treat myself and then I get right back on track. (sometimes a girl wants chocolate or cheesecake or BOTH). I am pleased with the results so far. I feel better."""
Xolair,"Asthma, Maintenance","""This is my 1st shot but I noticed a marked improvement. From 20 attacks a day down to 6. Was scared to try this medicine because I&#039;m allergic to a lot of medicines, food, etc. After the shot I experienced itching at injection site, sleepiness that lasted for 4 hrs. After that I felt energetic and a lessening in all over body pain. That night I slept through without any asthma attack, it appears to also be suppressing my Lupus. It is so great not to constantly have pain and an inhaler in my mouth and be able to walk more than 3 ft and stop for breath. Can&#039;t wait for my 2nd shot, I almost feel back to normal. Thank you for creating this medicine just wish it was cheaper."""
Atarax,Anxiety,"""Im 18, and I&#039;ve never been on medications before... i have performance- and social anxiety. So when i went to my doctors and asked for something to help me survive my everyday life, he recommended Atarax. But i have been taking them for 2 weeks now with no effect what so ever... granted, they are only 10 mg and small as a breadcrumb, but i was at least expecting some effect from it. The only thing i felt was nausea and dizziness.... must say im quite disappointed """
Buprenorphine / naloxone,Opiate Dependence,"""A friend told me told me to cut the sheets into quarters. So I did. I forgot to mention in my last post that I am 29 now.  Anyway, I have only take 2 quarters of a sheet today and I feel great.  No withdrawals and no thoughts or wants for pain pills.  I actually took 5 lortabs to work with me yesterday just in case the Suboxone did not work.  I was very comfortable with flushing them down the toilet this morning.  I am so thankful for Suboxone.  Life is already 100% better and I am sure it will get better.  The only side effect is that it was difficult to go to sleep last night.  Suboxone is a life saver and I would recommend it to anybody."""
Lysteda,Menstrual Disorders,"""This medicine is a blessing  I am 43 years old I eat healthy and exercise everyday except weekends. On March 15 2017 I was given the depot shot for my heavy bleeding BIG MISTAKE. From the shot I experience more bleeding and blood clots then I ever experience prior to me taking the shot. My bleeding continued for over 90 days I was admitted to the hospital for low blood and had to have a 4 pints of blood transfusion.  On  July 4 my doctor prescribed Lysteda I did experience some cramping and back pain but after 5 days of taking this medicine 3 times a day my bleeding stop completely now husband and I are much happier people!!"""
Magnesium citrate,Constipation,"""I had surgery almost a week ago and the pain medication gave me some insane constipation. I sent my girlfriend to the drug store to find a fast acting laxative. When she got there she asked the pharmacist what the best option was and they suggested magnesium citrate. I am glad they did. I needed immediate relief. He directed me to drink just about half and it should work within an hour. Well I threw it back and though it was definitely over an hour it worked! Highly recommend this product. I&#039;m actually still sitting here..Making sure it&#039;s all out. Once I got my first movement out of the way there was no stopping the rest. Amazing."""
Trintellix,Depression,"""I have been on many antidepressants and they all make me want to snack and overeat. I gained a lot of weight on all of the other antidepressants. I was so tired of gaining weight. About a year ago I started taking Trintellix and I am no longer craving snacks all day.  My depression was marked by feelings of irritibility and lots of crying. I feel 100% better. I think that this medication has worked better than any others I&#039;ve tried. So relieved."""
Magnesium sulfate / potassium sulfate / sodium sulfate,Bowel Preparation,"""Prepping tonight for tomorrow&#039;s procedure.  I&#039;m now in the restroom for a while so why not do this?  Taste isn&#039;t great.  Smells like cough syrup and tastes like salty,  watered down, Nyquil in my opinion.  I chugged it; finishing the first dose in about 10 minutes.  It kicked in after about 20 mins. I am tiny bit nauseous, but no headache as I&#039;ve seen on other reviews. Bowel motion is literally water and at first couldn&#039;t even feel it. Now, after my 3rd trip, things are pretty raw. I&#039;m using a toilet paper, baby wipe, vaseline combo."""
Desogestrel / ethinyl estradiol,Birth Control,"""I have never reviewed a medication online but I would like to warn others about this medication. I have taken several different birth control pills due to the fact I am so sensitive to synthetic hormones. My doctor prescribed me to cyclessa to see how my body would react to the hormones in this medication. Let me tell you do not waste your sanity or money on taking this!!! Out of all of the pills I have taken this BY FAR has been the most awful experience. I experienced the worst anxiety and depression of my life. I got to the point where I wouldn&#039;t even answer the phone if my friends or family called me. I was crying and extremely emotional over everything. Sex drive=RIP, dead. I also became extremely mean to my fianc&eacute; for no reason."""
Vortioxetine,Depression,"""If I could give this drug a zero, I would! Doc started me on 5 mg and I took ONE pill, with a small snack, right before bed. The next day I had nausea so incredibly bad, I couldn&#039;t move or function! I was dry-heaving all day, had no appetite, and twice, got very clammy and felt like I was going to pass out. If those problems weren&#039;t enough, during the evening, I had the most painful headache I&#039;ve ever had in my life! It also made me feel anxious and irritable. I decided to NEVER take this drug again and am STILL severely nauseous, and incredibly fatigued, two days later!"""
Tramadol,Chronic Pain,"""I was taking 50 mg. of Tramadol 3/day for a total of 150 mg daily with no problem for over 10 years. My new doctor became nervous about prescribing a 3-month supply (270 pills), and switched me over to the 200 mg. Extended-Release formula. I tried it for 2 weeks, and it doesn&#039;t work, so I started supplementing it with either Advil or Tylenol. This is definitely not good. I&#039;m now taking a higher dose of Tramadol but have to take additional drugs."""
Aluminum chloride hexahydrate,Hyperhidrosis,"""Since I was 12 (I am almost 20 now) I have had a terrible problem with armpit sweat. I went years just dealing.. getting rid of my cute shirts for black shirts instead, and wearing jackets even in the Florida heat. I never bothered to ask my doctor about it. It never occurred to me that anything but surgery or botox was an option.
I tried clinical deodorant after clinical deodorant and while one might work for a day or so, I would inevitably begin sweating again within the third application or so.

This is my second day using Hypercare.. and although it tends to BURN after applying.. within an hour or so it goes away and I was left feeling completely dry up to my next application.

This is such a huge boost to my self esteem!"""
Parnate,Depression,"""I have been on Parnate for 1 year now. I have been on many other antidepressants. Parnate has certainly worked for me. There are still some days that I feel just a little down but nothing compared to the major depression I had suffered. Before my doctor Put me on Parnate I had been hospitalized and underwent ECTS successfully. Now I feel good finally. I do have to watch the foods because I hyperventilate and also severe diarrhea. Plus I am on 50mg of Seroquel in the morning and 100mg in the evening. Parnate is 10 mg x a day, which is low compared to some people.

Abilify,Agitated State,"""I started this just a week ago for severe anxiety brought on by some recent experiences I had.  In the 13 years I&#039;ve been seeing my psychiatrist I&#039;ve never had such panic.  He immediately asked me a couple of questions, knowing me very well, and then prescribed the lowest dose.  I was hesitant but couldn&#039;t see any other option than I give this a try! WOW! For the first time in about a month I feel more &quot;normal&quot;!

I am cigarette free now for 7 weeks, and there are times that I would happily sell everyone I knew into slavery(yes an exageration) for a smoke, but these have become much fewer, and also much less intense.  To point now I had one today, the first this week, and it lasted a couple seconds and was gone.  Compared to how it was before using this, when it would result in an hours of restlessness until I got a cigarrette. 

I would recommend to anyone wanting to stop, it will still take willpower, but this will make those low times much easier to handle, and also make them fewer."""
MiraLax,Constipation,"""I hadn&#039;t had a &quot;satisfying&quot; bowel movement for weeks. Just a little bit here and there. I weight lift and monitor my calories and weight so I knew the constipation was getting serious when my weight was up by at least 5 lbs despite being on a &quot;cutting&quot; diet.

I took miralax over two days (two doses total )- and wow, it really worked. Once I went to the bathroom, it was like a floodgate opened (sorry for the graphic description). But it came out firm yet soft.

I had no painful urgency or side effects, just a natural urge to go.

The only negative side effect I had was painless gas. Lots of it. But totally worth getting back to a regular state.

I&#039;m going to keep taking this for a few more days just to make sure I get back to regularity."""

My Neurologist says I have some of the worst he&#039;s ever seen in all the years he&#039;s been in practice. I receive Botox treatments every 3 months and the only medicine that really alleviates the pain after trying dozens is Norco. Insurance wants to charge $32.00 per pill which I cannot afford, so luckily I get a few samples each month.

Gabapentin,Peripheral Neuropathy,"""I&#039;ve had neuropathy for around 8 months. My first dose of Neurontin (300mg) made me feel very &quot;loopy&quot; for several hours. So loopy that I only took 150mg 1x a day for the next two weeks. I had a couple of good days on it and sometimes the medicines took the edge off my pain. But it didn&#039;t take the pain away fully and made me extremely moody and act out of character.

Nimotop,Ischemic Stroke,"""Ive been on Nimotop since 1997. It is truly a miracle drug. I went from a stroke and an inoperable aneurysm and wasn&#039;t able to speak, think or walk. Today I am walking, writing, speaking and feel like I&#039;m a miracle."""
Nexplanon,Birth Control,"""I had seen everywhere that spotting was the worst symptom of this. Once I got the nexplanon my period stopped immediately with no spotting whatsoever! Yay! On the downside, I was a little emotional for about two weeks. Once that wore off, I became extremely exhausted and hungry all the time. The symptoms have eased up within about two months. I still get pms-like symptoms but no actual period. Overall I adore this birth control method! No babies and no having to remember to take a pill!"""
Lorazepam,Anxiety,"""For three months I suffered from debilitating nausea (without vomiting).  I couldn&#039;t get out of bed because I constantly felt like I was going to vomit.  It was absolutely horrible and I could not figure out what was wrong with me.  I&#039;ve always been an anxious/stressed out person but never thought that it was out of the ordinary.  Finally my family forced me to go to the doctor and she told me that because of my upcoming life events (getting married, moving out) and because of my Type A personality, it&#039;s likely I have a slight chemical imbalance in my brain which could be causing my extreme nausea. She put me on sertraline, but also gave me lorazepam for sudden anxiety/nausea attacks. My nausea is GONE and I feel better than ever!"""
Carbatrol,Epilepsy,"""I&#039;m 51, been having seizures since I was 12. Carbatrol and Depakote are what I&#039;m taking now for about 20 years. These are the only medications that seem to work for me, I&#039;ve been considered controlled, I drive, the best thing that happen to me. Only thing they are just so expensive."""
OxyIR,Pain,"""Works well for the pain and works fast, also with IR you know when it is going to take effect."""
ParaGard,Birth Control,"""23, no kids, 1  year. I am one of the lucky statistics that for some unknown reason, expels IUDs. (Twice now with the Paragard) but I did want to share despite that, my positive experience in general. Being young I knew this would be a convenient means of longterm birth control   the no hormone aspect really enticed me. Have had bad experiences with Nexplanon and pills. Insertion: wasn&#039;t horrible for me, felt like a weird really invasive pap that clamped down inside you for 5 seconds. 2 days of cramping and heavy bleeding after. Positives: convenience, no weight gain, acne, hair loss or anything like that. Negatives: heavier period bleeding, possibly painful sex. My cervix was super sensitive and sex was less pleasurable than before."""
Benadryl Allergy,Allergic Reactions,"""I have had allergy all my life, pretty severe and I live in allergy heaven in TX. I have tried Everything and for me, benedryl is still the best.
I work and it does not effect me, I often take it several times a day."""
Genvoya,HIV Infection,"""I was on a robust regimen (for 8 years) that was working great, but seemed like a heavy load (2 x per day, multiple pills...) and what attracted me was the once per day option and &quot;easier&quot; effects on my biology. I began taking Genvoya and, unfortunately, lasted only 2 weeks. My fingers were tingly &amp; going numb, my heart rate was stressed, intense fatigue began to be a problem, muscle aches and then my sternum started to hurt . My doc let me know if Genvoya proved not to work for me that I could easily go back to my previous med combo. I chose to do go back and VOILA!, I feel 100% better and all side affects are subsiding or are gone after only 2 days. For me, I felt like I was taking poison - was this really researched?"""
Desogestrel / ethinyl estradiol,Birth Control,"""Just about to finish my first month of reclipsen. I had never taken birth control before and was a bit terrified to start this one. I noticed I was very emotional and cried a couple of times even at work which had never happened in the year and half that I&#039;ve worked there. My breasts did swell a little which was nice since I&#039;m an A cup. My period started 3 days into the inactive week. I&#039;ve always had painful cramps and trouble sleeping while on my period but this one was by far the worst. The first night I started my cramps were extremely painful and I couldn&#039;t fall asleep after waking up in the middle of the night for the first two nights. Acne is the same it hasn&#039;t helped or made it worse. Overall this has been a decent 1st experience"""
Ethinyl estradiol / norgestimate,Ovarian Cysts,"""Sprintec overall had a positive effect on my body, regular periods, bigger breasts, no weight gain, increase in sex drive, and helped quite a bit with acne. Four months into it I caught a yeast infection which is the only downfall I&#039;ve noticed."""
Linzess,"Constipation, Chronic","""I&#039;ve been taking Linzess for a year and honestly can say it&#039;s a life saver ! Of course like any drug it comes with its pros and cons but for the most part to not feel jam packed everyday is such a relief! I also need to plan my day around the drug and I have found a schedule most suitable for my daily routine. I work a full time job and get home around 5pm. I&#039;ll take 145 mcg with a bottle of water and eat dinner. I know by now I will not have a BM until 8-9pm. FLUIDS are key! I have rapid diaherra then I&#039;m good to go to bed by 11pm. I&#039;ve also taken many times before drinking alcohol and the drug would not activate whatsoever (FYI, no other negative sides w/ alcohol). I also drop a few pounds and the following morning always look my leanest!"""
Pylera,Helicobacter Pylori Infection,"""Everyone&#039;s differvent but for me personally. 26 year old, 160 pounds, sorta in shape. I felt permanently hung over with a metallic taste in my mouth. Lack of sleep as week really hit me. Try to stay active or entertained. Take time off work if you can. After a while everything feels like a dream"""
Depo-Provera,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,"""Took the depo shot for the first time earlier this year. Completely changed me my personality and my body. I break out easily I bleed all the time .

Bupropion / naltrexone,Weight Loss,"""Started Contrave 4/17/2017. It works lost 4 pounds, no side affects except extreme dry mouth which I drinks plenty of water. I take 2 pills daily."""
Trazodone,Depression,"""With all due respect, don&#039;t listen to the naysayers. Its a great medication. No loading period, you can come off at anytime and it is only mildly addicting when taken in high doses for long periods.
You will sleep, it will keep your anxiety and depression in check and it will allow you to be yourself again. People who tried it for a night and complain in reviews have not given it a chance.
I don&#039;t understand, do they prefer to have their brain chemistry altered forever by paxil? lol Trazadone is a SARI and a minor one at that. I don&#039;t want to be a slave to paxil and the like forever, hence traz is a much better option."""
Ethinyl estradiol / norethindrone,Acne,"""Looking over these reviews, it&#039;s such a relief to know that I am not alone in dealing with the HORRIBLE, EMBARRASSING and PAINFUL cystic acne this has caused me. Until starting, my (then) clear, flawless skin was the thing I liked best about myself. HOWEVER, within a month, this had truly RUINED my skin forever. Excessive and deep cystic acne that did not respond to any dermatologist treatments and sent me into a spiral of low self-esteem. Gyno insisted I stick with it for 6 months to see if it evened out. IT DID NOT! Instead, what I&#039;ve been left with is unresponsive acne for the past two years (yes...1.5 years after I stopped taking this) because of this horrible pill. Also, did not work properly and gave me 2 periods/month :) STAY AWAY!"""
Alprazolam,Anxiety,"""Acts very quickly and definitely feel the calming effect. The only downsides is that it doesn&#039;t last very long (2-3 hrs max, maybe even less) and you quickly build up a tolerance for it so you end up having to take much more the more you use it."""
Doxepin,Insomnia,"""I have been using Ambien for years for sleep maintenance.  I tried Silenor over the last week and it&#039;s been fantastic!  I don&#039;t have any side effects whatsoever in the morning.  Slept 7 hours straight every time I took it."""
Cyclobenzaprine,Sciatica,"""I take a 10 mg pill before bedtime. I sleep like a rock and am foggy half of the next day. The pain is relieved only for the next day or so."""
Magnesium sulfate / potassium sulfate / sodium sulfate,Bowel Preparation,"""Piece of cake.  I stopped eating meat, poultry, and fish 2 days prior.  Ate low fiber foods day before prep, and only liquids day of.

Placed Suprep and water in freezer one hour before drinking.  Mixed it as per instructions, and drank it all through a straw in 10 minutes flat.  In between drinks, I&#039;d swish some Powerade around to kill the after taste.  Drank my 32 ounces of water in another 15 minutes, and waited.

Didn&#039;t have to wait long!  45 minutes after the first gulp, it had arrived at the other end.  Off and on the toilet and it was over 90 minutes later.

The 3am feeding produced the same results, but this time it only took 15 minutes to arrive.  1 hour later, it too had finished.

No chills, nausea, or headache.  Taste not that bad."""
Topamax,Migraine Prevention,"""I have been using Topamax for 1 year and I have not had a migraine in a year.  Before taking Topamax I was in bed for 9 months with a migraine headache."""
TriNessa,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,"""I&#039;ve been on this birth control for quite a while now, and it&#039;s made me very depressed. Especially when I&#039;m alone and not doing anything I feel very sad and depressed. And every other month or so I&#039;m bleeding abnormally. Though I don&#039;t have a period every month, I shouldn&#039;t be bleeding all the time."""
Implanon,Birth Control,"""After insertion, the site where it was inserted had a dull pain that still lingers today. A couple months in I threw my tablet at my mother in a blind rage. When nothing was wrong in my life I felt a constant irritation with the people around me. I would have times where I would be nauseous for a week and a half at a time accompanied by smell sensitivity. I have lost weight but have been bloated, with constant headaches. :("""
Sprintec,Birth Control,"""I&#039;ve been on this medication for 3 months and I thought my side effects would get better as time went on, when in reality it&#039;s only gotten worse. I feel nauseous everyday, I don&#039;t ever want to eat, my doctor told me to take it with protein but every time I eat I feel even worse. I&#039;ve been losing sleep every night from feeling so sick in my stomach, I feel really depressed and my anxiety is through the roof! My follow up appointment is in a few days, I cannot wait to get off of this!"""
Metronidazole,Rosacea,"""It really hasn&#039;t seem to change anything for me other than it lightened a tiny bit of the redness. I&#039;m hoping its just because I&#039;ve only been using for 3 weeks. Hopeful but skeptical been down this road many times, nothing seems to work entirely for me."""
Ethinyl estradiol / ethynodiol,Birth Control,"""I have a love and hate relationship with the zovia 1/35 birth control pill. Back when I was younger in my teen years even early 20s it worked amazing. No weight gain at all. I stopped taking it for a few years when I started my family and now 10 years later decided to get back on it. Let me just say, weight gain! I don&#039;t blame the pill 100% but I feel like you have got to be prepared for how hungry this pill makes you! So you will be hungrier than usual and eat more and hence gain weight on it. Its getting out of control, I have decided to stop this month."""
Implanon,Birth Control,"""Love it. Girls Implanon is amazing.
Positives:
1. no pill phone alarms any more. 
2. no worry for three years.
3. no period for 7 month yaaaaaaaaay (I had it inserted in June 2010).    
4. I got nothing of the side effects they are talking about.   
5. no more hormones, no more crying or mood swings.     

I only got low libido, which is fine for me. 
When I got it inserted, didn&#039;t feel a thing. It was smooth and easy.   

But few hours after that I got worried because I could feel it, even without touching my arm. It got sore, no one could touch me there(but it was not bad at all)!

Now after 7 months I don&#039;t feel it, it&#039;s not itching."""
Belviq,Obesity,"""I began this medication a few days ago and it&#039;s been a Godsend, thus far.  My main problem in the past has been nocturnal eating.  I&#039;d wake up, barrel down to the kitchen and -- whilst half asleep -- devour PB&amp;J, pasta, whatever-the-heck was in the fridge.  That&#039;s gone.  As a result, I&#039;ve been sleeping through the night.  I don&#039;t often feel hungry and when I do I control my portions with ease.  No nausea or headaches - yet.  I felt a bit &quot;strange&quot; my first day on it, but that may have been a result of not feeling hungry 100% of the time.  I was also slightly lightheaded my second day; may have been a result of reduced caloric intake.  I&#039;ve yo-yoed a lot and finally feel that the monkey is slipping off my back.  RECOMMENDED."""

Sertraline,Borderline Personality Disorde,"""I first started taking this in 2012 and at first all it did was make me incredibly tired but then it also made my moods more up n down and caused me to have psychotic episodes. i abruptly stopped taking it at that point (stupid i know....i shouldve tapered off) and from doing so i had extreme psychotic episodes. 
Ever since taking it all those years ago, ive had numerous psychotic episodes. My dr thinks it was the sertraline that reacted badly with my brain, leaving me now prone to having psychotic eps. 
I tried different dosages too, starting from the smallest dosage. I would never recommend it to anyone after what i experienced with it but then again everyone is different. All i know is that Sertraline made me worse mentally."""
Finasteride,Androgenetic Alopecia,"""Complete Brain Fog, worse than anything you can imagine, literally can&#039;t get out of bed because of the brain damage that this drug induced on me, I feel completely literally detached from the world now, not to mention even the less serious it caused, ED, no Libido, Head Pressure, complete cognitive shift, feel like I&#039;m in a whole different world, NEVER TOUCH this drug EVER EVER EVER, unless your old and have nothing else to lose and don&#039;t care about life any more.

Victoza will definitely tell you what you can and cannot eat.  Most of my side effects have gone away.  My morning blood sugars have been lowered by approximately 50 points.  I work crazy hours and I have to keep glucose tablets in my vehicle.  I just cannot pull over to eat regularly. I suggest this medication to anybody who has Type 2 diabetes."""
Brilinta,Prevention of Atherothrombotic Events,"""I had a stent installed in right ventricle at 80% blockage. And then I was put on Brilinta for 1+ year. Minimal problems.

I was a runner, now am walk/jogger...a few miles/day, few times a week.  Still experience some pressure/breathing occurrences during first few minutes, then I walk, and restart jogging. After a while (10-15 minutes, about a mile)  this tends to go away and I can jog a little longer. No way to determine if any of the meds contribute to this.

I also take probiotic yogurt even though my gastroenterologist did not told me about it. I hope this works. !!"""
Ibuprofen,Muscle Pain,"""A soon as I took it I started having blurry images, I couldn&#039;t breathe and everything turned for the worse. I feel like everything that surrounds me are circling or rolling."""
Cymbalta,Anxiety,"""Works okay for me. I went on it because Cipralex (Lexapro) pooped out on me. Doesn&#039;t deaden my emotions as much as other drugs. Anxiety is pretty much non-existent now but my depression remains. No side effects. I put on a lot of weight on Cipralex and it hasn&#039;t come off while on Cymbalta, but it hasn&#039;t increased either. I haven&#039;t had any notable side effects. Oddly, I did have an irritated sciatic nerve when I started Cymbalta and while I wasn&#039;t put on it for that, it did kind of help that too."""
Effexor XR,Anxiety,"""Started taking Venlafaxine ER a year ago for anxiety. Started at 75mg daily and am currently on 150mg per day, and have been for about 8 months. It has helped a ton with the anxiety! While I am not completely clear from anxiety, it is much much better to handle. I did not gain any weight whatsoever. I do notice that if I forget to take it I feel a bit nauseous and lightheaded so I have set an alarm on my phone. I take both 75mg pills at one time so that it&#039;s done for the day. All in all, I would recommend!!"""
Terbinafine,"Onychomycosis, Toenail","""Been using for 5 months, my doctor advises one more month of use. Had fungus on 2 nails and my big toenail that was 80% infected has improved to about 15% remaining.

Monthly blood draws to check liver enzymes are normal."""
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""So I got this implant 08/2015 and the first 4 months my periods were normal and first 2 months I had a few mood swings. After the 3rd month everything seemed normal for about 3 more months. No weight gain, or mood swings or anything but now it got pretty bad. I went without a period for two months but now that it&#039;s back I get it every 2 weeks. I saw my dr yesterday 7/272016 and said that it is thinning out my lining so maybe that&#039;s why I am having my period more often. She prescribed some estrogen to see if it balances everything out and if not then I will need to take it out."""
Contrave,Obesity,"""I stated taking Contrave a week ago I lost 7lbs so far. I don&rsquo;t feel hungry but I eat about 3X a day low carb some protein and fiber. I drink plenty of water. I sometimes feel nauseous. I don&rsquo;t like to take medications but I am trying to continue taking it because it seems like it&rsquo;s working.

I started on Rebif and it made me feel horrible, so then I took Tecfidera which ended up giving me major joint pain to the point of not being able to function at times. So I was able finally  go on Gilenya and so far so good. The only side affect so far is extreme fatigue which we all know we already have plenty of that with MS. Gilenya allows me to function &quot;normal &quot; again and play with my daughter.  Hopefully it will continue to work for me and keep away any new episodes!"""
Prazosin,Nightmares,"""Been taking 1mg of prazosin for the last 2 months for PTSD nightmares that were causing sleep problems. Nightmares stopped the first day I took it but, I experienced severe headaches, dizziness, drowsiness, nausea and a lack of energy. As I got used to it, the symptoms gradually improved but did not go away completely. If I&#039;ve been drinking, the symptoms will worsen but it is bearable.

I stopped taking it because of extreme pain on my left side, right below my breast. It didn&#039;t feel like any gas I&#039;ve ever had, but I guess it was some type of intestinal pain.  I was also having frequent, urgent bowel movements though not diarrhea as they warn about.  Now five days without the meds, and I&#039;m still nauseous, especially after bowel movements. I&#039;m bloated, gassy, and just generally feel awful.  What a mistake it was to trust my dentist on this one!"""
Ethinyl estradiol / norgestimate,Birth Control,"""Had no issues on this! No noticeable weight gain or change in mood or anything. Got my period during the placebo week which was nice, because my period was super irregular before (got it anywhere from 28 to 54 days in between cycles). Only once did I start getting my period a day or two before the placebo week, so my OBGYN put me on an extra dose of estrogen pills the next month to balance it out. That seemed to fix it. My acne cleared up a bit too. Only switched off it to get an IUD, but if I was going to stay on an oral BC I would have had no reason to leave this one."""
Sulfasalazine,Psoriatic Arthritis,"""I was on sulfasalazine after being diagnosed with PSA.  My first arthritis medication.  I was also experiencing reactive arthritis when first diagnosed. I started at 1 tablet 2 times a day.  I had some quite adverse reactions to start, trouble sleeping and nausea.  Rheumatologist suggested humeria.  After reading up on humeria I decided it was worth trying to soldier through a longer trial period with sulfasalazine before switching, eating plain food etc. to minimise impacts of side effects.  So glad I did.  Now at 4 tabs/day.  All the side effects are now gone and I can eat normally.  Sulfasalazine has reduced joint inflammation to the point that I can exercise. I recommend giving sulfasalazine side effects a bit of time to equalize."""

I went into emergency at the hospital and was treated for a migraine... a migraine was not what the problem was I have a blood clot in my brain caused by being on this pill for 1 week.

(I am a Realtor) Since starting this drug two weeks ago at 10mg daily, I am a new man. Within 3 to 4 days I noticed a difference. I now feel 10 years younger. I have a renewed love of life and my family. I give it 9 out of 10 because it does cause some nausea and drowsiness, so I just take it before bed.

I stopped using it in Mid January and was pregnant in February. The patches always leave a &quot;goo&quot; around them. Use alcohol to get it off - normal washing doesn&#039;t work."""
Fentanyl,Pain,"""No side effects.  In the beginning, they didn&#039;t help much at all and my pain management specialist (neurologist) had to increase my dosage quite a few times until we found a level sustainable.  I am now not as confined to my couch or bed like before.  Original dosage began: 12.5mcg 72 hours but no impact in controlling my pain level.  My current dose is 75mcg/48hrs.  I am opiate tolerant and will probably be increased to 100mcg.  In addition to Fentanyl, I also take Norco 10-325mg 6xday, Carisoprodol 350mg 4xday, Xanax 1mg at least 1xday and will start taking Chantix to stop smoking next week (Nov. 30, 2009).

Started taking Wellbutrin about a month ago and I haven&#039;t felt this good in years.  I started feeling better almost immediately.  I am motivated and focused and like my old self again. In addition I stopped smoking completely about a week after I first started taking it. Only negatives are I am having a REALLY hard time getting enough sleep and the dry mouth is bad but only on occasion. I really hope that the insomnia gets better because although I feel great, I know it can&#039;t be good to have such little sleep long term."""
Mirena,Birth Control,"""I have to say.. After reading reviews I was a little terrified to get Mirena inserted. However, my ob is really good and it wasn&#039;t a big deal at all! It was uncomfortable like a pap but it was done within a few mins.  I gave birth 8 weeks ago and he said this was a good time to get it inserted because my cervix is still soft. So maybe that&#039;s why it was no big deal for me? So far, no cramping, slight spotting. I&#039;m not sure about the long term effects of the mirena because I&#039;ve only had it in a week. So far, so good!"""
Loratadine / pseudoephedrine,Nasal Congestion,"""I took Claritin D this morning because of severe nasal congestion, it was relieved after few hours but the side effects is not good, I can&#039;t sleep. I am so tired and want to rest but I am still wide awake until 1am. How I wish, I read the reviews first before taking it..so no more Claritin D...I will go back to Allegra."""
Paroxetine,Panic Disorde,"""I have been on Paxil 6 weeks now. I am feeling so much better it is a miracle. In this experience I realized that I had some issues that I needed to face and some grudges that I needed to let go that had built up over the years. I thought that I would never experience another normal day again because my anxiety attacks and depression were so severe I thought my life was over. I tried to avoid taking medicines and fighting my anxiety off myself but anxiety started to take over my life. """
Triumeq,HIV Infection,"""Triumeq is working as an HIV medication - but I am gaining weight."""
Proctofoam HC,Hemorrhoids,"""Pretty quick pain release, combined with high doses of Ibuprofen is quickly effective ."""
Axert,Migraine,"""I take 200 mg of Topamax daily.  I have tried Imitrex, Relpax and Maxalt.  Maxalt was okay. I have had no side-effects with Axert.  It usually relieves my migraines within 10-15 minutes maximum."""
Isotretinoin,Acne,"""I&#039;ve been on Claravis for 15 days today, and so far there is no improvement. After about 10 days of use, I broke out very badly. Everybody that&#039;s saying they&#039;ve already improved after a week or two couldn&#039;t have had very bad acne to begin with. The doctor said that results won&#039;t start appearing at all until at least 3-4 weeks, but at this rate, I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll be seeing any soon. I have pretty severe acne, and have ever since 7th grade (I&#039;m a senior now). My side affects at this point are very dry skin - particularly the nose, mustache area, chin, and lips - I have slight muscle aches in my back and neck that I didn&#039;t have before, and I&#039;ve been getting an abnormal amount of bloody noses since I started (at least twice a day.)"""
Lorcaserin,Obesity,"""I started Belviq 8 days ago. I did experience dizziness, headaches and tiredness for the first few days but now I&#039;m back to normal and down 8.5 pounds!  What&#039;s even better is that not only is my appetite gone, I also get full very quickly so even when I&#039;m not eating as healthy, I only get between 1/4 and 1/2 (if even), which means I still lose weight."""
Nexplanon,Birth Control,"""I&#039;ve had this form of bc 4 years now. About one year after using this product I started having mood swings feeling so weak and tired,but never thought about my Nexplanon having to be the blame! Making an appointment next week to have it removed!! I use to never take a nap after work now just about everyday I feel awful if
 I don&#039;t lay day to nap I fell sick to the stomach..I really want to feel like myself again..I would not recommend this BC"""
Norethindrone,Birth Control,"""I started taking Heather shortly after giving birth so that it wouldn&#039;t reduce my milk supply and I&#039;ve been taking it for over a year now. I am still breast-feeding and have not had a period this entire time. I&#039;ve also noticed that my moods are greatly restrained, meaning I almost never cry (even when I want to, like funerals), but I also don&#039;t get overly happy either. I&#039;ve been losing weight this whole time (still overweight), which may be related to the breast-feeding or not."""
Hylan g-f 20,Osteoarthritis,"""For anyone considering SYNVISC, I&#039;d like to share that I&#039;ve had both knees done twice &amp; will continue to have the injections. Some background: I&#039;m 59 yrs old, 5&#039;6&quot;, approx 175lbs. The first time I had SYNVISC injects. (in both knees), it took about 5 weeks to experience the full benefits, but once it &quot;kicked in,&quot; there was ZERO pain &amp; complete fluid mobility! For almost a year, my knees felt &quot;brand new!&quot;  
I&#039;ve recently had a second set of injections (both knees) and although there has been a bit more to pain in the recovery, each day there is definite improvement. 
I must caution anyone who gets these injections not to panic if there is noticable pain initially after the injections. Take it easy. It gets better!"""
Nexplanon,Birth Control,"""It was TERRIBLE. I have had Nexplanon for 1 year (June 6, 2013 - Scheduled removal appointment May 27, 2014). For the first 4 months, I got my period very heavy for about a week and would spot everyday after my period until the next month. After that stage, I would have a period for about 2 weeks and wouldn&#039;t spot for about 2 weeks. It has been this way FOREVER and I don&#039;t know why I gave this Birth Control so long to ruin my sex life. I broke out on the sides of my face.. which is Hormonal Acne. I do not recommend any one get this BC. Stick to condoms and the pill. """
Skyla,Birth Control,"""I&#039;m 21, no kids, got Skyla about a month ago after dealing with crazy mood swings with a different bc  I was taking. The initial insertion was pretty painful but only lasted about a minute, got extremely light headed and nauseous after insertion but went away within 20 minutes, I got mine done at planned parenthood which I&#039;d suggest and was even able to get it for free through a program they have and only paid for implantation. So far pretty pleased with the IUD itself, good sex drive, my mood swings have completely decreased, overall very very happy I got it, the only downside it random cramping that can be pretty uncomfortable but there&#039;s usually a few months after starting a birth control where your body adjusts so hoping they stop soon."""
Wellbutrin,Depression,"""I spent a lot of time reading reviews and it took me awhile to even start the medication but I finally said screw it I&#039;ll try it. After reading the reviews most people said they felt better almost right away so after 2 months when I still wasn&#039;t feeling great I started to get nervous. Then 3 months approached and I started crying less and less and I actually got excited to do things again and by 4 months I feel great!! I&#039;m so glad I stuck with it. If your depression is bad this really can take up to 3 months but don&#039;t give up! I did have to take buspar with it because I&#039;m just naturally an anxious person and that helped with my anxiety and to balance it out. I now take 100mg of bupropion in am and 100mg in afternoon and it&#039;s just enough!"""
Fluoxetine,Depression,"""After being diagnosed with anxiety and depression Prozac is the first antidepressant I was prescribed. It took a while to kick in my body and then I had to even up the dose after a month or so. After faithfully taking it everyday I noticed I started to stutter a lot. I&#039;ve never in my life had a speech problem. It got so bad that I had to stop taking it although it did make me feel better every day. Hoping to try something else!"""
Doxepin,Insomnia,"""Doxepin does not help me fall asleep. It does help me stay asleep. I suffer from anxiety and depression and that&#039;s why I can&#039;t sleep. To those people who have experienced extreme tiredness the next day this also happens to me even though I take it as the manufacturer suggest for Sleep maintenance which is to take on a completely empty stomach 3 hours after a meal. Otherwise the onset is delayed even further. By several hours leading to next day sedation even more. Even when taking the proper way it has a 15-hour half-life which can still leave you tired and groggy the next day which I also experience even taking it correctly."""
Tizanidine,Muscle Spasm,"""Zanaflex has been very helpful with my ability to finally have a good nights sleep. No side effects, relaxes me and is NOT addictive. At least for me it is not. It does NOT &quot;heal&quot; the muscle spasms. I would recommend Zanaflex for people with severe muscle spasm."""
Duac,Acne,"""So I was prescribed Duac on Monday 11th by my doctor after trying 3 different types of treatment which didn&#039;t really work!
I know it&#039;s early days but I have seen slight improvement already!!! 
I have had no side effects at all, no burning sensation, no flaking skin, doesn&#039;t make my makeup go cakey either! 
Absolute love this so far!!"""
Mirtazapine,Anxiety,"""I&#039;ve  been taking the drug for about 5 years for an anxiety. It was an absolute godsend for me. It takes a few days for the body to settle in but it&#039;s worth it.   It allows me to function normally. Yes it does have a sedative effect but l take it at night which only helps me get to sleep. Yes l still suffer from mild anxiety occasionally but it is manageable. This allows me to focus on the cause which is usually procrastination of life issues such as money/health."""
Microgestin Fe 1 / 20,Birth Control,"""Before I got on this pill I was experiencing extreme extreme cramps to the point where I could not sleep through the night without waking up two times each hour from the pain. I started this pill and have been on it for about a month now and have not got cramps at all! All of my cramps have disappeared! I&#039;m so happy for that. However, spotting did happen all through the first month until I got my normal period. Although my period has been way lighter! So far so good, we&#039;ll see how it plays out though."""
Pristiq,Depression,"""I learned that it is best to take Pristiq in the morning because it is a stimulating, time release drug. I try and take it by 9 am. It can affect sleep if you take it later. I had decreased appetite and some nausea so take with food in the morning. I avoided any caffeine and alcohol as that can increase side effects."""
Tioconazole,Vaginal Yeast Infection,"""It was my first time having a YI this week. So I bought monistat day 1 and used it last night before bed. I read the reviews about how it burned and itches for hours but I didn&#039;t have that experience lucky for me. When I woke up the next morning not only was my YI not treated my entire &quot;area&quot; was swollen and in a little pain if I touched it. It hurt to walk but I made it to the doctors as soon as I got up and my doctor diagnosed me with a YI and prescribed me &quot;fluconazole&quot;. I&#039;m hoping it works better than monistat did but I will never use that product again. And my biggest advice to anyone out there who has a YI you should go to your doctor instead of trying to cure it yourself. Or use anything BESIDES MONISTAT!!"""
Zyban,Smoking Cessation,"""Smoking @ 16 for 41 years, had in that time 2 dvt&#039;s. Stopped after first day on Zyban, never touched tobacco since.
Fabulous product."""
Ethinyl estradiol / norgestimate,Birth Control,"""I love Mononessa. I used to have extremely painful cramps, I would have to miss work and school because I was in so much pain, and  Mononessa has definitely helped. At first it didn&#039;t seem to help with the cramps so I went back to my doctor and she uped my dosage. My periods come on the exact same day every month which is really nice. I definitely don&#039;t have as heavy of a period and it normally lasts 3-4 days. I do seem to be a little more emotional the week before I start but I never had any weight gain/loss issues with it."""
Nexplanon,Birth Control,"""I was on Nexplanon for less than 3 months, bleeding was light but periods lasted for weeks, no weight gain but was unable to lose weight. Dieted, workouts, and even saw a personal trainer yet nothing. I became very hormonal, depressed, and constantly tired. I just had my implant removed this afternoon. For me, having to take a pill everyday is much better then the side effects of Nexplanon."""
Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""I got kyleena inserted today. Let me tell you whoever said slight cramping is crazy it was the worst pain I have ever felt. It was the last day of my period so I wore  a pad and only had only a few drops of blood, after I got it inserted I was gushing. It&#039;s been about 5 hours since it&#039;s been inserted still having slight cramping but nothing as bad. I&#039;m going to wish for the best no babies for me!"""
Levitra,Erectile Dysfunction,"""I&#039;ve tried all of the big 3 multiple times and Levitra is the clear winner. Cialis doesn&#039;t give the rock hard results that Viagra and Levitra do and you get a headache for it. Levitra works faster than Viagra and definitely lasts longer. On an empty stomach I&#039;m ready to go in twenty minutes and can go even the next day on the same dose with Levitra. Viagra works but takes 30 minutes at least and sometimes longer to get results. You have maybe three good hours with the Vs."""
Contrave,Obesity,"""I tried Contrave and could not stand the nausea and vomiting. Sick to my stomach. I didn&#039;t appreciate the side effects really. """
Adipex-P,Weight Loss,"""I&#039;ve been on phentermine since Sep 2, 09. I was 291lbs. today, still taking it, I&#039;m 248lbs.That&#039;s a loss of 43lbs &amp; there are no words. For about 6 weeks I didn&#039;t take the drug because of certain reasons. Coupled with exercise, running 1.5 miles 3-4 times &amp; doing Zumba 4-5 times a week &amp; watching what I eat. I see the results &amp; I&#039;m very proud. I&#039;ve found that phentermine is not meant as a simple, quick fix, but is to help change your body AND mind so that you can maintain because a change of mind has taken place once you are off. I suggest exercising when you start taking it because the weight will come off even if you do nothing, and that can be deceiving in that you won&#039;t think you have to work as hard and you&#039;ll gain it back plus some when you stop."""
Docosanol,Herpes Simplex,"""I am on my 2nd day using Abreva&reg;, so far so good. I like how it numbs the area and stops the Itching. Very Relieving! In regards to &quot;quicker healing&quot;, It has helped in avoiding a larger breakout. My breakout isn&#039;t as big and nasty as it gets without treatment so I am pleased so far, some things work different for others so I can only speak for myself but it never hurts to try!"""
Acetaminophen / dexbrompheniramine / pseudoephedrine,Allergic Rhinitis,"""I have used Drixoral for years and it is the only one I really get relief from.  I am very upset it is not on the market."""
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""I&#039;ve had Implanon for about4 years now. I just got it reimplanted. If I recall correctly you do spot the first year or the first two years. I just don&#039;t remember spotting as much the third year. Your mood may change a bit. You may get some acne. You also may gain some weight. I don&#039;t know how it affects my sex drive. This is what I&#039;ve experienced. HOWEVER, in comparison to other birth controls, this one is great. The bloating and backache that I got when I was on my period is nothing compared to the small bloating and backache you may get when on this. I get no cramps or fatigue. Depo Provera gave me hot flashes. The NuvaRing kept falling out."""
Nortriptyline,Migraine Prevention,"""I found the taking nortriptyline was very helpful especially when your head is hurting beyond a 10 . When your in need of some super relief in minutes. """
Bupropion / naltrexone,Obesity,"""I am a 35 year old woman who has been fighting with my eating issues since I was a child.  Thanks to this medicine for the first time in my life I am not compelled to finish my plate and am perfectly happy sticking to a 1200-1500 calorie diet.  I finally know when I&#039;m full from eating. I have had zero side effects from contrave.  No nausea, no constipation, and thankfully no seizures.  I had decided along with my doctor that the possible side effects were far outweighed by the results.  I started the pills April 21st and am down 50 pounds as of June 22nd.  This is a life changer!"""
Cymbalta,Osteoarthritis,"""This was great for pain relief for the two months I was taking it. The problems I had far out weighted any benefits. I was suffering from blackouts where I would do things and not remember doing them. The depression, nausea, and headaches were unbearable too. I have been off it for 2 months now and am just starting to feel better. I&#039;ll live with the on-average 8 pain."""
Uloric,Gout,"""Had gout flares on &amp; off for 30 years. Usually prednisone would clear it up. Tried allupurinol but it made my legs &amp; feet tingly. Tried uloric, no flare ups. Uric acid dropped to 1.9 on 80 mg. Dr changed dose to 40 mg, uric levels staying around 4. Only side effect I&#039;ve noticed is a big increase in dreams. No nightmares or bad dreams ,just a lot of regular dreams. Luckily its carried by the base pharmacy so there is no cost."""
Docosanol,Herpes Simplex,"""Did not work. I used it a day after I felt a small bump. I bought first thing in the morning, used it accordingly and did not see any quicker than usual improvement. 
Expensive for a very small bottle. I suppose it it did work for me it would be worth it and I would use it at least 3 cycles. However, it did nothing. My advice let it run its course. I&#039;m day 12 now and it&#039;s almost gone. Not completely. 
Highly disappointed with the product."""
Plan B,Emergency Contraception,"""My husband and I was in the heat of the moment and we slipped up he came inside me but when I felt it I pushed him off. We already have two children and at the moment can&#039;t afford another child with me joining the military it&#039;s just impossible at the moment. The next day in the afternoon so approximately 17 hours later I went out and bought the generic version of plan B (the cashier assured me it works the same) for $43 that&#039;s including tax. I felt fine after taking it the next day I felt bloated but I knew that was a side affect I just slept it off. Day 3 I didn&#039;t feel too well but I figured it was the pill taking its course. It&#039;s been a week and a half now and I just started my period 10 days early which is another side affect. Works!"""
Implanon,Birth Control,"""I got my Implanon out 2 days ago after having it for the full 3 years , I loved it for the fact I didn&#039;t have to worry about it or getting pregnant, downside is I gained about 4stone and I&#039;m only 20! It was so hard to not gain weight, hopefully now it will be easier, no acne thank God. Having a break from all contraception for a few months and get back on track."""
Betamethasone / calcipotriene,Psoriasis,"""This was prescribed to me for scalp psoriasis after trying a medical shampoo and another topical lotion with no relief from the itch and flakes. I found within the first few applications it relieved the itch and got rid of about 90% of the plaques on my scalp. I have been using it for almost a month now and its made a worlds difference for me! 
The only reason I&#039;ve not given it a 10/10 is how greasy it is, its hard to apply and much harder to remove from my hair. 
After trying a couple of things I&#039;ve found that the trick is to use baby oil to break down the stickiness and use dish soap to wash it out (I do this step at night before bed) then in the morning I use Loreal&#039;s extraordinary clay hair mask to absorb the remaining baby oil!"""
Metronidazole,Bacterial Vaginitis,"""I&#039;m now 30 and have been battling recurrent bv for years now. My Dr. now has upped the dose of metronidazole to 250 mg 4 times daily for 10 days. The average dose never was able to to get rid of it for me. But this last time taking it I haven&#039;t gotten rid of it, so I&#039;m prolonging it another 10 day round. Side effects do suck. I drank on it accidentally forgetting I needed to stay away from alcohol and got really sick. I also take the flagyl but I&#039;m on it longer and its harder to tell if its gone away yet because of it&#039;s side effects. I just worry my body is getting used to the antiobiotic since I&#039;ve used it so much. I&#039;ve tried all the home remedies I found online too. Metronidizole is the only antibiotic I&#039;ve tried that does work to get rid of it."""
Ethinyl estradiol / levonorgestrel,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,"""I&#039;ve been taking Camrese for almost 6 months and have had nothing but problems. I went on birth control because I had very irregular periods like sometimes a year apart. So I wanted to regulate them so I knew when they were coming. I never had a lot of acne before and ever since taking Camrese my skin has been terrible. Like no matter what I do it doesn&#039;t clear up. I&#039;m bleeding all the time basically for the 3 months with a couple days off. I can&#039;t wait to finish this cycle and either get off birth control completely or switch to a new one because this has made me miserable. Plus the mood swings on it have been ridiculous as well."""
Tamiflu,Swine Flu,"""This medication was seriously a life saver.  I was diagnosed the day after I started showing symptoms and took it pretty much after I left the pharmacy.  I went from a 102 fever to normal within six hours.  It&#039;d day three and I still have a bit of a cough, but I don&#039;t feel nearly as wretched as I have the past couple of days.  The only complaint I would have is it makes me dizzy if I stand up for too long at a time."""
Benzaclin,Acne,"""I&#039;ve been using this for about 3 years now. This is probably the first product I&#039;ve ever used that resulted in clearer skin, both on my face and my body. I went from having at least 5-7 big red pimples at all times, often more when I was on my period, to having clear skin with maybe a few small blemishes most of the time. It took a few months before I noticed it was actually working. Everything was great until 2 months ago, I now have acne just as bad, if not worse, than ever before (face and back). I still use Benzaclin but it&#039;s had absolutely no effect, which is extremely disappointing. Back to square one I guess."""

Skyla,Birth Control,"""I got the Skyla put in about three weeks ago. I made my appointment before work thinking I would just have some mild cramping (I can take pain). Nope. It was all good until the doctor got to my uterus. I&#039;m 19 with no kids, and this was the most uncomfortable pain in my life. I could barely stay still and I was screaming on the table. When he was finally done I went pale and felt like I was going to pass out, doubled over with the worst abdominal pain ever. He got me ibuprofen but that did nothing. I had to make an emergency call out to work and I had to stay in the office for at least 45 mins. Could barely drive home and horrible cramps at least 5 hrs after. Now I just take ibuprofen some days I have cramps some days I don&#039;t."""
Sumatriptan,Cluster Headaches,"""Works in about 15 minutes for me which is about twice as fast as the pill form. Creates a bad taste but well worth it for the faster speed."""
Methocarbamol,Muscle Spasm,"""I never knew untill reading this that you can use methocarbamol as an drug addiction helper. I started taken them 5 month ago I only take them once or twice a day if needed 750mg ones. I also take 80mg MST twice daily .

Doxycycline,Acne,"""I&#039;ve always had mild teenage acne since middle achool and nothing worked. I finally decided to go to the dermatologist to get rid of my acne once and for all. Once I got the prescription I was told to avoid dairy. I was so nauseous every day throwing up at school for a week straight. But other than extreme nausea and occasional vomiting within 2 months of diligent pill taking 95% of all my facial, shoulder, chest, back, and cystic acne has cleared. Other than take with food and dairy or prepare for some side effects this has worked wonders. Highly recommend."""
Thyroid desiccated,Hashimoto's disease,"""Ditto all the positives written by other reviewers.

I quit. And for the next six years at every doctor appt. I flat out refused synthroid.  I think one of the 20 plus fillers was the issue.   Doing my own research I begin requesting Nature Thyroid.  Was told the clinic  only prescribed synthroid. 16 months ago I won!  And have been happy since on NT.  UNBELIEVABLE then when I moved and my new doc in different state suggested I change.  No way.

Eszopiclone,Insomnia,"""I finally decided that I&#039;d suffered with insomnia for long enough and my doctor prescribed 5mg of generic zopiclone.  I get the metallic taste shortly after taking it but I&#039;ve learned to keep a small glass of OJ beside the bed. This medication has been my saving grace! I almost get excited when the metallic taste comes now because I know I&#039;ll be sleeping shortly thereafter! If you&#039;ve suffered from insomnia like I have, a little metallic taste in your mouth is a SMALL PRICE TO PAY!  I highly recommend zopiclone for insomnia!"""

I was crying for no reason and had no interest in anything.  On Pristiq 2 days now and I feel &quot;different&quot;.  My mood is lighter and I&#039;m not going off on angry tangents for no good reason.  I&#039;m glad it&#039;s not supposed to put on weight - I&#039;m 140 lbs at 5 feet 7 and as I just quit smoking, I will be putting on a few pounds from that.  So far, it&#039;s pretty good."""
Isotretinoin,Acne,"""At the age of 25, I had severe hormonal acne appearing under my chin and on my jawline, deep black heads, scarring, super oil face and hair before taking Accutane. This medication is totally worth it! I&#039;ve tried so many OTC medications, prescribed so many creams and oral pills, chemical peels, dieting, Proactive, etc. Nothing worked! I used to have horrible skin in high school as well and it cleared up for a few years then the acne came back. I went to my dermatologist and she recommend Accutane for 5 months. The first two months I had the initial break out and it sucked but I knew it would get worse before it got better.  My face was pretty clear by the third month. By the fourth month I only had little scars and now I&#039;m acne free!"""
Singulair,Allergic Rhinitis,"""Started to get post nasal drip horribly over four months ago. tried every otc drug know for allergies, remove bedroom carpet, bought high end humidifier, air purifier, netti potted and drank four liters of water a day.

Its very expensive but worth every penny."""
Depo-Provera,Birth Control,"""I opted the depo shot when I was 16. I was horrible at remembering to take medicine on time so I chose the shot. This is my experience. I can only speak for me.
I got the shot in May 2006. Stayed on track of the shot due to the reminder I had a Dr&#039;s appointment on such and such day. I had light, 3 day periods. Never a day longer, never a day shorter. I had no weight gain. I had no cramps. I had no breakouts. I did not experience any dizziness, shortness of breath, or headaches. I didn&#039;t lose my appetite. I had no troubles.
Then, like a genius, when I turned 18 I chose to get off the shot which was due in February. By April I had a positive pregnancy test.
Wasn&#039;t hard for my body to change from even after almost 2 years."""
Bactrim DS,Urinary Tract Infection,"""No health insurance. Went to the ER for UTI and was prescribed Bactrim. UTI symptoms quickly subsided (didn&#039;t disappear completely but like 90% better) so that was nice. Then the Bactrim symptoms started. Oh man. I had a different set of symptoms every day. First it was tingly hands and severe fatigue. Then I had a full blown panic attack (depression and anxiety can be made worse by Bactrim apparently so I tried to keep reminding myself of that). Last couple of days I&#039;ve had headaches and bad nausea. I&#039;m on day 6 of my 7 day course now-- gonna try my best to make it through the whole course but wowww it&#039;s tough. I just hope these symptoms clear up once my pills are gone. It got its job done but made me miserable in the process!"""
Levonorgestrel,Emergency Contraception,"""It all started when this guy I had sex with did it inside me, however I hadn&#039;t taken my birth control in about a year and it was on my most fertile days.

So thankful for this pill."""
Bupropion,Depression,"""Was taking 20mg of Prozac which worked pretty good. Have taken Adderall in the past for ADD and asked my doctor about it again. He suggested I take Wellbutrin. Been on it for 2 weeks and I really noticed a difference. I actually feel great! 300mg XL. Side effects are minimal. I did feel like a zombie the first and second day. The third day I had the giggles. But, things started to even out after that. It wasn&#039;t anything terrible. It is a little bit harder to go to sleep at night however, I&#039;ve never been a good sleeper. And, dry mouth is kind of bad. Other than that no anxiety depression. Haven&#039;t noticed anything about my ADD yet. I&#039;ll give it a couple more weeks."""

Acetaminophen / hydrocodone,Pain,"""My physician prescribed Norco 35-325 after I complained of severe abdominal pain and pain in my kidneys. I started taking one tablet every 4-6 hours (sometimes less than 4 hours apart) and it didn&#039;t seem to help with the pain, it would help me sleep sometimes. I started taking two tablets, and it seems to make a noticeable difference. It doesn&#039;t take as long to start working as if I were to just take one. It lasts a while longer too. I&#039;ve tried others and it works just as well but only when I take two."""

Phillips' Milk of Magnesia,Constipation,"""I remember this product when I was a kid. My mom used to keep a bottle of it in the house all of the time, that was decades ago. I have used the pill form for the first time and it still works quite well. I find the pill form a little more tolerable then drinking the liquid form. But, what I like about it most is that it doesn&#039;t cause the cramps. For anyone reading, the best time to take any laxative is at night before going to bed. Also take a full 8oz glass of liquid (water preferably) when taking any pill form laxative. Water helps with constipation to begin with. The directions call for 2 to 4 pills, I took 3."""
ParaGard,Birth Control,"""I&#039;ve had the Paragard for about a month. I&#039;ve had no problem with it. I had a C Section 11 weeks prior insertion. Insertion didn&#039;t hurt other than cramping while they were measuring how far to put my IUD. I had light cramping for about two days and spotting and bleeding for about 5 days which is expected. After that everything was great. Checked the strings everything in place. No problems. Now before I got pregnant I already had heavy periods and paragard does not help with that at all. I can&#039;t take hormonal BC due to a blood clotting mutation. When I got my first period after insertion flow was heavy which is normal for me. Cramping on the other hand was more than expected.

My face was as bright as a tomato (I haven&#039;t been in the sun). My face was peeling! I now have to have a face washer on my face to cool it down but I noticed that all my blackheads are gone and there&#039;s no sign of pimples.

Escitalopram,Depression,"""I was on Zoloft for 8 years and the side effects became unbearable and it wasn&#039;t working for me anymore.  My doctor switched me to Lexapro.  Its hard to say whether my side effects initially were caused by the withdrawal from the Zoloft or the Lexapro.  After a few days I felt like myself again.  I didn&#039;t have trouble sleeping, but I gained 10 lbs every 6 months.  I have had a lot of stress in my life and the Lexapro wasn&#039;t enough for me and had to take Xanax on occasions.  Lexapro does not treat PMS mood swings so I usually took the Xanax around my period.  It helped, but the weight gain was depressing and no matter what I did I was hungry all the time and couldn&#039;t lose the weight.  """

I tried using Opana alone but couldn&#039;t stand waiting IN PAIN for 2 hours before I could feel any relief!  Regular Oxycontin DID provide 12 hour relief without needing any vicodin for &quot;breakthrough pain&quot; but even with insurance it would cost $100/month.

My mother was noticing these changes in my personality, so then made me go to a therapist. That was when I was suggested to be put on Paxil. I was afraid to take Paxil, but when I was finally forced to, I noticed changes within a week with just 5mg. I moved up to 10mg, and everyone could see changes in how I acted everywhere. I am currently still on 10mg, but even a little can do a lot, even for you!"""
Copaxone,Multiple Sclerosis,"""Diagnosed in &#039;08, been on Copaxone since then. Took me about six months to realize my injection site problems were caused by the auto-injection contraception. I found it not precise enough, needle can go at an odd angle, or too deep and into muscle (those were the worst). Learned to self inject. I go in at a 45 degree angle and inject slowly. Haven&#039;t had any injection site problems since. Knick a muscle once in a while, but that&#039;s it. It&#039;s a different experience for everyone, as you all know.

I have no side effects, no diarrhea or pain, just a normal bowel motion, which feels GREAT for a change!

Imitrex,Migraine,"""This medication for the price worked the best. I was using this along with Topamax as a daily preventative and also started receiving botox injections.  I found that after a few months between the botox, the Topamax and the Imitrex, I was able to use less and less each month."""
Gabapentin,Anxiety,"""Very good medicine. Taking 200 to 300mg daily for anxiety, racing thoughts, poor sleep etc.  Have been on lamotrigine and risperidone for supposed BPD for years.

For me, MSG or any free glutamate sets off severe anxiety and migraines.  Some of you may have similar problem, so think about your diet too.  
For me gabapentin provides fast relief from a &#039;meal mistake&#039;.  Benzodiazepines worked pretty well for me, but now that I have this, bye bye. I used to use alcohol more than I should, but now don&#039;t feel the need too."""

Weight gain, drowsiness, headaches, fatigue, awful acne, swelling in my legs and ankles for over a year, you name it I&#039;ve experienced the side effect.. I do recommend it for endo patients with severe pain and bleeding but those who don&#039;t have endo I wouldn&#039;t not recommend it as the side effects would not be worth it."""
Lexapro,Depression,"""I&#039;ve been on lexapro for several years. I have to say for some the initial side effects can be overwhelming, but stick with it because it will help most of us. You can train yourself to overcome the sexual side effects, and weight gain can be controlled through proper exercise and diet. I&#039;m not an active person, but have to remind myself to hit the gym several times a week. Doing so will greatly and positively affect your mood as well, so just pretend like you have no choice and GO. Also please remember there is no &quot;magic pill&quot; we have to take responsibility for our own happiness, which includes lots more than just taking antidepressants! Hope this helps some!"""

I have very little side effects, like when on the blue pills in the pack, I have a little bit of acne but when my period comes at the end of the pack the acne goes away. I also have a little bit of bloating in the belly but no big weight gain and sometimes I get a bad headache an hour after taking it.

The Lexapro really did help so much with my panic attacks, but I still had generalized anxiety. After a lot of therapy and lifestyle changes, my GAD was very well-managed and I was able to come off of Lexapro. 2 months down the road, I had a huge relapse due to a medical crisis and my doctor put me back on Lexapro.

Finally decided to have my gyno remove it. It&#039;s been out for a week and half and I have been bleeding for 7 days. This is not normal bleeding. Very heavy bleeding with large clots. Some almost the size of a golfball. I&#039;ve read a lot of forums from people and this has happened to ALOT of people. This is something that nobody warns you about. Please do your research before you choose this drug. It&#039;s not worth it!"""
Colcrys,"Gout, Acute","""I like to say Colcrys 0.6 is THE BEST. I got the prescription barely yesterday and just about 8 hrs later I was without pain on my ankles and my burning disappeared, I was able to sleep. After being unable to sleep for 3 consecutive days.  Thanks to this wonderful medication I was able to sleep last night and able to workout. As for side effects only soft stools but nothing extreme. DEFINITELY I RATHER DEAL WITH SOFT STOOL THAN DEALING WITH ALL THAT BURNING AND PAIN ON MY FEET!  I truly regret not taking this medicine since 6 yrs ago. I just did not know I sadly have gout. GLADLY NOW I FOUND COLCRYS."""
Topiramate,Migraine Prevention,"""Extremely effective. I had been non-functioning for a while and this drug was a dream. The complete turn around made me tolerate things I shouldn&#039;t have and turn a blind eye to some important side effects. I ended up staying on it for about 2 years before my weight was stuck between 125 lbs and 128 lbs (I am a 6ft tall woman!), my morning 5-8 mile run had completely disappeared and I would have liked nothing more than to curl up and die. This is a truly horrible drug. It does exactly what it says and SO much more. I am so happy to be off of it."""
Humira,"Crohn's Disease, Maintenance","""I have had Chron&#039;s symptoms for about 10months. I was in severe pain with the constant inflammation. I was vomiting and the nausea was unbearable. I recently started humira. After one week of starting my injections, I immediately noticed that I had no more pain. I am able to eat without feeling awful afterwards. The only side effects I&#039;ve experienced are headache and fatigue, but nothing too unmanageable."""
Oxycodone,Chronic Pain,"""I am really glad to see so many positive experiences. I just wish I could say the same. I have been on Oxycontin 40 mg for 6 years. I cannot say that I have found relief. I have peripheral neuropathy   and I take the Oxycontin 40 mg twice a day and Methadone 15 mg four times a day. I am in excruciating pain at least 8 eight hours a day and I have trouble sleeping and now I am having a problem with constipation. I don&#039;t really think it is the medications fault I think my dose is to low to handle the amount of pain I am in. My doctor will not prescribe anything stronger."""
Oxytrol,Urinary Incontinence,"""I have overactive bladder &amp; Incontinence really bad for being in my late 30&#039;s. I never thought a single patch for 24 hours could even function for my disfunctional bladder. I put it on for the first time after I showered before bed, waking up I didn&#039;t feel as full and didn&#039;t have to rush to the bathroom. During the day no leakage at all when I walk and no urge. I feel normal again. All I know whoever invented this is genius cause it is so nice to not wear pads, but please just reduce the price a bit."""
Citalopram,Depression,"""I had been on 20mg citalopram for the past 3months for PTSD and depression. Recently have been increased to 40mg. I can&#039;t sleep at night, have a dry mouth/always thirsty and noticed the other night how tight I clench my jaw when trying to sleep. Today I have a sick/knotted feeling in my tummy, eat to settle it despite not feeling any hunger but it doesn&#039;t help. Dreams have always been ok. Made a mistake of missing a few days and the nausea was horrendous will never forget to take it again. X"""
Ethinyl estradiol / levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""Wanted a low dose oral BC after being off for about a year &amp; a half. Was rx&#039;d Sronyx from PP. I wanted low dose because I&#039;ve dealt with depression before. This pill made me absolutely crazy. I felt ok the first week but I&#039;ve never been more irritable, moody &amp; depressed.

Levomilnacipran,Depression,"""I&#039;ve taken several different SSRIs and SNRI&#039;s. This medication is the worst I have even taken. It makes me feel worse than I felt before I started taking anything at all - sweating, hot flashes, my mouth constantly tastes like I drank salt water, constipated, bloated, nausea, exhausted. You name It. EXTREME RAGE!!!! stay away from this med. it&#039;s a scary thing"""
Nature-Throid,Hashimoto's disease,"""I was on Synthroid and Cytomel for many years but my symptoms were never alleviated until I started Nature-Throid.

Clonazepam,Seizure Prevention,"""Sleepiness memory loss."""
Naproxen,Osteoarthritis,"""If you have any kind of stomach problems, these kind of medications aren&#039;t for you. It only relieved about 10-20% of my pain &amp; hurt my stomach in the process."""

Ocella,Birth Control,"""This may be premature I&#039;ve only been on it for a week, but I have been super moody. Irritable, cried 3x in past week and have developed a lot of pimples on my forehead and nose. I usually never break out only when on my period and not as much as this. I also am highly anxious...I&#039;m an anxious person to begin with but with the pill for this week I&#039;ve been near panic attack a lot and that hasn&#039;t happened in a decade. I&#039;m

Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""I had Nexplanon inserted Oct 26th 2016. I haven&#039;t had a period since December, which will always worry me. Plus side I haven&#039;t had any reasonable weight gain from insert. Downsides are the depression, mood swings, and my acne (I haven&#039;t had since high school) came back. I haven&#039;t lost sex drive. But I have pregnancy symptoms (per usual for most BC&#039;s). The biggest concern for me is getting no periods at all.

Betamethasone / calcipotriene,Psoriasis,"""Works much better then anything I have ever tried for my psoriasis.  The flaking from my scalp is probably reduced by 98%."""
Prozac,Anxiety and Stress,"""This medicine has been a life saver for me. It is the only antidepressant that has worked. I lost weight on it (which I needed to), feel less stressed, can handle stress, thoughts are not obsessive anymore, I laugh more and interact more with friends. I don&#039;t feel scared everyday. If you are thinking of taking it, give it at least 4-6 weeks to kick it. It&#039;s worth it."""
Docosanol,Herpes Simplex,"""Cold sores last up to 1 week to even 2 weeks if you don&#039;t use treatment. By using Abreva, you can shorten that time to around 4-6 days. Abreva isn&#039;t used to lower your cold sore nor get rid of it completely after only a couple of uses. It&#039;s used to shorten the length of your cold sore, very effectively."""
Gildess Fe 1.5 / 30,Birth Control,"""This birth control is AWFUL. My boobs hurt literally all of the time. My face is constantly breaking out and I&#039;m gaining a lot of weight. (Could be hormonal but none of the other birth control I&#039;ve been on have done this). My cramps are terrible and my period is light."""
Tamsulosin,Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia,"""I had severe urination problems at 64to 65 years of age. I couldn&#039;t hardly urinate when I wanted where I wanted. It was painful to urinate and could not empty out. I saw a urologist and had a camera stuck up my penis. My prostate is the size of battleship.  I have been taking this tamsulosin for nine months and it has made it so I can urinate with out pain. It has been great. Side effects are not so. Retrograde ejaculation takes the fun out of orgasm.   Sleepy and listless often.  I think I am going to have surgery to ream out the prostate, and have been weighing the  issues.  You might as well try this stuff on and make your own decision. For now, it sure has helped.    Before, I had to get up three or four times a night to pee a little."""
Xeloda,"Breast Cancer, Metastatic","""I am thankful this drug didn&#039;t kill me!  After taking this drug for 8 days the side effects started and went from bad to worse...blisters on hands, and hands and feet as well as every fold in my skin turned black and I had severe diahrea, that ended up putting me in the hospital for 6 days.  The medicine reacted to my colon and it was wide open, couldn&#039;t hold anything down, lost 17 pounds is 7 days, although the weight loss was welcomed, I wouldn&#039;t suggest going about it this way.  I stuck it out for the full 14 day regime and my doctor believes that with taking the drug for the first cycle hopefully it shrunk some of the tumors which are in my jaw, spine, collar bone and left femur.  New treatmen coming after I recover from Xeloda!"""

Ethinyl estradiol / norethindrone,Birth Control,"""Hi Judy ....do you think I should accept this ....

I was on this pill to help with ovarian cysts and heavy periods. I&#039;d give it a 10 out of 10 for helping with those!!! However, I took it EVERY DAY at the SAME TIME for the last three years and am 7 months pregnant. I don&#039;t trust it as a birth control at ALL!"""
Relafen,Sciatica,"""A good initial substitute for ibuprofen to keep symptoms at a minimum."""

Linzess,"Constipation, Chronic","""Just started last week. So far I love it. I have been going for colonics every 10 days just to empty because I could no longer do it myself. My doctor even suggested removing my large intestine due to nerve damage and lack of motility. I am so glad I tried this drug first. I take it at bedtime and I do get up a few hours later and have watery stools but I will take that over getting up all night and pushing myself inside out with no results. A lot of people writing about how it interferes with their mornings so maybe they should take it at a different time and that may help. I never knew that so many people had the same exact problems with constipation like me. Thank you to everybody who took time to post. I don&#039;t feel so alone now."""
Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,"""Please don&#039;t get on this bc . I&#039;ve been on it for 4 years.

I don&#039;t know what to do. I wish I  would&#039;ve done some research before getting this birth control. I&#039;m embarrassed at times and becoming stressed out . What can I do to slower or maybe even stop this bleeding?"""

Sulfasalazine,Rheumatoid Arthritis,"""Nasty stuff.  First had extreme tiredness, then stomach pain, diarrhea, headache, fever, chills, rash.  Went to emergency. Was on it total of 3-1/2 wks.   Stopped it two days ago, still not well. Maybe go back to methotrexate."""
Copper,Birth Control,"""Had it for 2 months (had to get it removed because it was sitting too low). Loved it while I was in. Insertion was very painful but it did not hurt the week after. Period was heavy for the first 3 days and I had to use a super jumbo tampon and pad. However, my once serious menstural cramps were completely gone (no midol needed). Would recommend to a friend. Wish it didn&#039;t sit low would have kept it in forever. Don&#039;t be discouraged by the negative reviews."""
Pristiq,Anxiety,"""I&#039;m taking Pristiq for mild anxiety. Side effects include interrupted sleeping patterns, severe constipation, and decreased sexual drive/inability to have orgasm. Anxiety has decreased tremendously and I feel great (i.e. more patience, focused, clear headed), but not sure if side effects are worth it."""
Ondansetron,Nausea/Vomiting,"""Sometimes have really terrible heartburn, due to my birth control pills, and sometimes causes bad nausea. Wanted an alternative to promethazine. Work great for taming the nausea, but the side effects were pretty annoying. Terrible backache and constapation. Oh man. Won&#039;t be taking these unless I&#039;m dying or something."""
Fetzima,Depression,"""I was surprised to see that there were some reviews that showed it wasn&#039;t helping some people. I&#039;m very sorry for that. Depression runs in my family. I&#039;ve been on over 20 different antidepressants throughout my life. Nothing has ever worked. I don&#039;t recall any improvement from anything. I started fetzima about 2 years ago. I felt relief within 1 week. I couldn&#039;t believe the difference within 2 weeks. I have experienced some rough times. I&#039;ve had a few suicide attempts and woke up in ICU 3 times. I&#039;m not trying to say I&#039;ve had it worse than anyone. I&#039;m just saying that was the place I was in. This was the only med that worked. The only drawback is the cost. It&#039;s very expensive without a savings card."""
Sotalol,Atrial Fibrillation,"""I have been on this drug for 3months and have not had an attack of Atrial Fibrillation, the only problem is it makes me very tired."""
Adapalene,Acne,"""I&#039;ve been on this for about a month and my acne has gotten way worse. My cheeks and forehead are covered in white heads with very red skin around them. It has also made my skin dry. But I&#039;m going to wait another month because my doctor said after two months my skin would be completely clear."""

Bupropion,Anxiety,"""I have severe anxiety and I would get anxiety attacks everyday. My doctor first put me on Fluoxetine on the highest dosage. After a couple of months my body got use to the medication and it was helping a lot with the anxiety. But I continued still getting the anxiety attacks just not everyday. So then he put me on bupropion 300mg with the fluoxetine and after awhile my panic attacks slowly went away. Now it has been over a year since I have been on the bupropion and my dosage is reduced to 150mg and my fluoxetine dosage is lowered to 20mg. I am happy to say that I have not had a panic attack for 2 years now. This bupropion is a really good medication and I find with using the combination of the fluoxetine it has helped me amazingly.

Lurasidone,Bipolar Disorde,"""Been at this 2 weeks, 23 male - and I&#039;ve got to say, the results are beyond my wildest expectations. Having run the gauntlet of antidepressants, stimulants, mood stabilizers, and seroquel (arrrrgh!) what surprised me most about this med was how fast it kicked in! I went from a suicidal-existential hole to -dare i say it - normal in a matter of weeks! I started out on 20 but it wasnt until I reached 40 on the second week I began to see results. Last night I went out on a date - and those with social anxiety associated symptoms will appreciate just how much of an accomplishment this is after months of wallowing in self pity. It does cause slight akathasia, but it&#039;s very slight and completely worth it. Im smiling, engaged, and content!"""
Nicotrol Inhaler,Smoking Cessation,"""I was a smoker for almost 40 years, with occasional attempts at quitting with the nicotine patch/gum, cinnamon sticks, &amp; cold turkey. None of those worked since I constantly craved a real cigarette. I&#039;ve now been using the Nicotrol Inhaler for over 2 weeks. I am amazed; as soon as I start to crave a cigarette, I just grab the inhaler and take a few puffs; that ends that craving.  Even when a canister is &quot;dead&quot; I still puff on it; it helps keep me on an even keel, having something in my mouth that I can puff on helps. I use 6 to 14 canisters a day, depending on both my stress and boredom levels, especially since some of my smoking was when I was bored. Only negative for me has been interrupted sleep, a small price to pay."""
Celexa,Anxiety and Stress,"""I have had depression my whole life. Tried Zoloft, Effexor, and 3 other medicines. I have been on this for a month now and its been great. Still have sadness but that&#039;s normal because I lost my dad not to long ago so I am still grieving, but the tiredness was the worst side effect and I still have it but I am hoping that it will go away the longer I take it. Only reason I didn&#039;t rate it so high is because I haven&#039;t been on it too long."""
Galantamine,Alzheimer's Disease,"""My husband is 69 and has been diagnosed with Alzheimer&#039;s and dementia.  He started this medication about two weeks ago.  He is already showing signs of improvement.  He is able to read and comprehend what he reads.

Lupron,Prostate Cance,"""at age 60 biopsy showed prostate cancer psa was 10. had it out.  After it was out, psa still ten.  Started Lupron and psa dropped to 0 for two years.  Then my doc suggested I  go without the lupron... I did for 8 months and my psa climbed to 4. back on lupron and it dropped to zero.  Did lupron for another year, then went off of it again. Why? The side effects, bad arthritis hot flashes, weight gain, 30 lbs in first two months, then no more.  No libido and everything shrinks.  No body hair. It was a joy to get off that stuff for awhile but my psa started climbing again. Now back on Lupron, but no change in psa.  Went to a monthly shot, my psa stayed at 4.  Added Casodex, grew boobs,  really bad.  My psa is now 2.  I&#039;ve been fighting cancer now for 6 years."""
Paxil,Obsessive Compulsive Disorde,"""I only started Paxil last night. I took 5mg and about 2 hours later it felt like a steel curtain had dropped on my looping intrusive thoughts. ADs have always been a problem for me. They only work to an extent and the side effects are intolerable. I&#039;m taking Paxil long enough to hopefully bridge my way from the difficult place I&#039;m in right now, to some place where I feel more confident and comfortable. This morning, the intrusive thoughts returned with renewed vigor. I took another 5mg and again, 2 hours later they were gone. It&#039;s surreal being present. I&#039;m used to spending my time ruminating on the past or fearing the future. This will take some getting used to, but if this is a sign of things to come, I have hope."""

Until the Zyprexa was added I still experienced bipolar breakthroughs, insomnia, and extreme anxiety and OCD on a daily basis, which exhausted me.  So far Zyprexa manages my symptoms, although I haven&#039;t been on it very long.  I also have food cravings, however no significant side effects.  I&#039;m very sensitive to medications, can only take very small doses.  What works for me might be too little to help others.  My doctor was very surprised to find out that a mere 15 mg Zyprexa for emergency breakthroughs would work for me.  Now I don&#039;t need to carry Zyprexa with me everywhere, because the nightly dose of 7.5 mg is enough."""

I previously failed Celexa, Lexapro (allergic to Lexapro), and Wellbutrin. I love Viibryd- My moods are improved, I&#039;m slower to react to angry situations, and I&#039;m sleeping better. I&#039;m noticing a nice boost in my libido. One small side effect I have is that I get what is called &#039;brain zaps&#039;. It just feels like someone is shocking my head. Quick, kind of annoying, but tolerable. I get this sometimes right before I take my daily dose- like the medicine is &#039;wearing off&#039;."""
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I started using another weight loss medicine on March 24th.  The first 60 days I lost 22 lbs.  During the third month I was not seeing any changes and switched to Adipex-P. I used Adipex for 45 days and have lost an additional 10-12 pounds. I did not experience any of the side effects or jitters except sleeping.  I tend to only get 6 hours of sleep a night."""
Contrave,Weight Loss,"""I asked my doctor to place me on Contrave because I had hit a wall with my own dieting and exercise. I was also looking for assistance to reduce/eliminate my alcohol intake. (I&#039;m a weekend warrior in my socializing.) I have been on Contrave for a week now. I lost 7lbs in the first 5 days. I workout with a personal trainer 4x per week. I cut caffeine and alcohol from my diet due to the headaches. I don&#039;t even crave a drink! I&#039;m starting week 2 with the pills. As of 7.21.17 I weigh 164lbs at 5&#039;9. My goal weight is 140lbs. I gave Contrave 9/10 only because of the headaches,  which are minor. I&#039;m very happy with my results thus far and my trainer is blown away! I&#039;m getting weighed in this Thursday again. I&#039;ll check back in after."""
Miconazole,Vaginal Yeast Infection,"""As I lay here weighing the benefits of clawing the inside of my own vagina vs. continuing to let the medicine take effect, I wish more than anything i never inserted this devil cream inside my body in the first place. This is night one for me, and I&#039;m just going to tough out the YI and not use it again. EVER. I can&#039;t do another night of this. The mild itching I had before is NOTHING compared to the itching I have now. If there were sandpaper near me, I would use it. Repeatedly. Inside and out. I can feel my heart beating in my vagina. That&#039;s the pain I&#039;m feeling."""
Loestrin 24 Fe,Birth Control,"""I started Loestrin 24 to regulate my periods. But I didn&#039;t like being on the pill, I gained weight, had mood swings, and lost my sex drive. I always felt bloated and it was so uncomfortable. The only good thing that came from taking this pill was that after I stopped taking it my periods stayed consistent."""
Lamotrigine,Epilepsy,"""I have complex partial seizures. After trying 17 different drugs. Yes,17.  I basically had to sign my life away into to be part of a drug study on lamotrigine when it had not been approved by the FDA yet. I take 300mg x 2 daily. I rarely have a seizure. (I do take it Tranxene with it as well). I now have been taking Lamotrigine since about 1987. The only problem was getting me on the right dose. I am happy as a clam."""
Trintellix,Major Depressive Disorde,"""I started on 10mg of Brintellix about two weeks ago after being taken off of Wellbutrin and Celexa. Right away I started to feel physically ill. Horrible headaches, sour stomach, extremely agitated and tired. I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s withdrawals from the other medicine or effects from starting the Brintellix. I am leaning towards the latter though. I just took my medicine and only an hour later I am feeling very ill again."""
Guaifenesin,ibromyalgia,"""I have been using guaifenesin as a treatment for the reversal of fibromyalgia symptoms for 4 years. As an RN, I was very skeptical since there aren&#039;t any positive studies done for this purpose. I had suffered with fibromyalgia symptoms for 12 years, was nearly bed bound, and was researching electric scooters. After relocating to Hawaii, I met an RN who leads a fibromyalgia support group focusing on utilization of guaifenesin. Having nothing to lose by trying this treatment, and trusting a fellow RN, I began the protocol. 4 years later I&#039;m walking a mile daily, cleaning my own home, engaging in multiple craft activities (ceramics, sewing, painting, and gardening), swimming, and enjoying life again. This has given my life back."""
Linaclotide,"Constipation, Chronic","""Took one Lizness and 30 minutes later had massive cramping from my stomach and intestines. If I even took a sip of water it got worse. Rolled up in a ball crying all day, no one, not the doctor or pharmacy had any idea of how long it would last. Best guess was 24 hours. It stopped at 9pm for the most part and started at 5.30am. Today my entire body is sore to touch, bloated and horrible stomach ache. Can&#039;t eat anything. """
Plan B,Emergency Contraception,"""I took the pill four hours after sex and a few weeks later found out I was pregnant. So for me it wasn&#039;t effective at all. Also, as it warned me on the box I almost vomited, luckily I didn&#039;t but it was a close call."""
Carbamazepine,Epilepsy,"""This is the only medcine I am allergic to.  Extreme itching!  I couldn&#039;t stop taking it too fast.  Luckily,  it doesn&#039;t have a very long half life."""
Bupropion,Depression,"""I had a SEVERE ALLERGIC REACTION TO THIS MEDICINE."""
Diphenhydramine,Nausea/Vomiting,"""I get severe migraines and was given this in the hospital instead of traditional nausea meds. It work well and I now use it at home and actually works better than Zofran or Phenagren."""
Citalopram,Depression,"""I&#039;ve been taking 10mg of citalopram everyday now for 7 days and then had to up it to 20mg after that. Have never felt so rough! Those first 7 days were hell for me, really bad headaches sickness and very bad depression that felt worse than what I had to begin with! I hadn&#039;t been able to eat anything either 4 or 5 days into it, but i tell you now the first day I took the 20mg start of week 2 absolute different story. I&#039;m like a different person. Please stick the first week out as that was the worst for me it does get better I promise. Stick it out I nearly didn&#039;t but so glad I did now! i feel brilliant now. These tablets do work but give your body time to accept them and you&#039;ll reap the benefits. Be strong and stick it out. Tomorrow is another day :)"""
Oxcarbazepine,Bipolar Disorde,"""Works pretty well for stabilizing moods, mostly manic. I take 300mg morning and 600mg at night. Have been taking for about three years. Dr will not let me take more than the 900mgs. Headaches for a week when starting and during increasing dose. It does mess with my memory. I can forget asking someone a question three times and sometimes have some trouble remembering words I&#039;m trying to express."""
Metronidazole,Bacterial Vaginitis,"""I am currently taking the twice a day 500 mg tablets and I can&#039;t explain how happy I have been and how comfortable I feel now that my infection has cleared up . The pills for me worked rather quickly by the third day I was clean. I don&#039;t mind the awful taste of the pill if it&#039;s going to work , what I do is either open my mouth wide and drop it at the end of my throat or put it inside a small piece of food and swallow. I also get dizzy at times but as long as I drink water it goes away . I experience bloating and I&#039;m gaseous but it&#039;s nothing I will stop my treatment for. And it is true please DO NOT DRINK ! The first day i took them I forgot the doctor said not to drink and i felt right away stomach cramps and dizziness ."""
Levitra,Erectile Dysfunction,"""Have been experiencing mild Erectile Dysfunction for several years, but never been a major problem until recently. Mainly because of a high stress level with work and some other things. My doctor gave me a prescription for 20 mg Levitra. I didn&#039;t feel like I needed the whole 20 mg, so I cut it in half. I took it about an hour before bedtime, and just a few minutes later I could feel it kick in. We went 2 rounds last night, and I could have gone a few more, and I&#039;m still feeling it working this morning. The only side effects was some stuffiness but nothing too bad, and a mild headache that went away with some aspirin. """
Clindamycin,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,"""I got pseudomembranous colitis from this medicine but it put my MRSA back into being dormant."""
Tradjenta,"Diabetes, Type 2","""I have been on Tradjenta for 90 days. I have gained 13 pounds, my daily fasting numbers are up by 20 points, my joints and back ache regularly, I have diarrhea several times a day and I have no energy. Today I called my doctor with all of these side effects and he told me to stop the medication and keep track of my daily fasting blood sugar. Wish I could do it on my own, with NO drugs!!!"""
Ethinyl estradiol / levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""I&#039;ve only been on this pill for two days... That&#039;s why I gave it 5 stars and I know it&#039;s a bit rushed but oh boy. I&#039;ve had an insane head ache all day. I also feel very nauseous, like I could throw up any minute. My heart is also pounding pretty fast and hard. Not sure what that&#039;s about but if it doesn&#039;t fix within a month I&#039;ll definitely be discontinuing this brand."""
Arimidex,Breast Cance,"""I have had minimum side effects."""
Acetaminophen / hydrocodone,Pain,"""I have been taking Norco for about a year now and it works for me with very little if any side effects. I had surgery on C2-C3, C3-C4, C4-C5, C5-C6. The surgeon wants to cut again on C7. Had a plate with screws put in neck in 2006. I have Degenerative Disc disease with severe bilateral neuroforaminal stenosis. I take 10/325 of Norco three times daily and it helps the pain and is keeping me from surgery on C-7. Only 30% of all neck surgeries are successful and will stay on Norco to prevent surgery as long as it works and for now it is working, with no side effects."""
Nexplanon,Birth Control,"""For me this was the worst control ever. I got this implanted after I had my daughter she is 15 mouths so about 14 months now. This is the worst thing that ever happened to me. I was 128lb post partum and I am now 150 and I&#039;m only 4&quot;11 so I look huge. I have always been small. My vision is effected, no desire to have sex even tho I love sex. Mood swings I&#039;m always crying or angry. I&#039;m always in a fog. Sometimes I feel like I&#039;m not even living. I&#039;m very tired. In order to do anything I have to drink and energy drink and I&#039;m so fatigued that the energy drink only makes me feel like I&#039;m well rested not jacked up on energy. When I get a peroid it is crazy long. Works for some but its not worth the side effects."""
Ascorbic acid,Dietary Supplementation,"""Great immune booster."""
Yaz,Birth Control,"""I got on this birth control when it first came in 2006 when I was 16, I was on it up until I was 22. Switching was the biggest mistake ever. I LOVED this birth control. I never had any problems with it. Lighter and shorter periods, cleared up my skin and no bloating or weight gain. The only downfall was I did get very emotional but that was it and maybe occasional breakthrough bleeding. Best of all it worked for me. I am switching back to this birth control and can&#039;t wait."""
Insulin degludec,"Diabetes, Type 2","""MY experience has been amazing I started on lantus and progressively my A1-C kept getting higher 100mg of lantus and slidin scale of novalog easily for ten year&#039;s . So I talked to my doctor and asked her to try teojeo with me that didn&#039;t help either my A1C was at an 8+. Two month&#039;s ago I started tresiba my A1C after two months dropped to 7.1 and I lost 16.4 #s . MY attitude my energy has increased I&#039;m feeling a 110% better all in two months. I&#039;m glad the rep talked to my doctor about this med it&#039;s been a life changer."""
Clarithromycin,Sinusitis,"""Clarithromycin seems to be quite effective with sinusitis. I hate the side effects though.  This antibiotic produces a bitter/metallic taste in my tongue. I haven&#039;t experienced diarrhea, but I now poop once in the morning and once in the evening. I used to poop once a day before taking this antibiotic."""
Zofran,Nausea/Vomiting,"""I&#039;ve been dealing with extreme nausea and vomiting for the past 6 months, and it finally got to the point where I couldn&#039;t take it anymore and went to the ER. They gave me Zofran through IV and was feeling better in about an hour. After I was released I was on 4 mg every 8 hours and for about a week I was back to my old self. Then things started to go down hill, and they boosted it to 8 mg. Now it doesn&#039;t evenwork anymore and makes me more nauseous than I was before. I also got pretty bad constipation and headaches after taking the medication. Not to mention, if you&#039;re taking the tablets be ready to handle the taste because it is DISGUSTING."""
CellCept,Systemic Lupus Erythematosus,"""Taking 2000mg a day with mild side effects.  Tremors in my hands when I first started and when the dose was increased.  Those have since stopped.  Also experience some sleep problems, but this could also be due to another medication.  My body responded very well to the medication and my condition has significantly improved in just a few months.  Hoping for continued success on the medication."""
Klonopin,Anxiety,"""This is the drug that was a total game changer for me. I was on effexor and abilify because of severe depression and suicidal ideation (at only 19 :(). While the abilify and effexor helped with the depression, I was extremely anxious, jumpy, panicky, and unable to sleep at all. Klonopin changed all that. I am now able to do anything with no anxiety, no intrusive thoughts, and am visibly much less tense and more relaxed than I have ever been. I can go to work, take public transport, and interact with customers with absolutely NO anxiety anymore. If you sound like me, I highly suggest at least giving this medication a try. It saved my life."""
Bisacodyl,Bowel Preparation,"""Had a little stomach cramping and nausea just as with any other laxatives I&#039;ve taken.  I&#039;m very satisfied though because it really cleaned me out.  Exactly what I wanted!!!.  Thank you!!!"""
Mirtazapine,Obsessive Compulsive Disorde,"""I tried this after Citalopram quit on me after about 5 years. What an awful drug for me. It did little for my anxiety and OCD. Some OCD symptoms actually worsened and weaning off it caused extreme anxiety to the point of panic attacks. I&#039;m finally off it after the final rude downshift and am trying Zoloft with good redults so far. Good riddance to bad rubbish."""
Suvorexant,Insomnia,"""Nothing at all. I am writing this after taking 15 mg dosage. Was on Ambien generic 6.25 mg and it worked great. Then my pharmacy started using a different Ambien generic that had no effect whatsoever. Instead of just changing to the name brand my doctor gave me samples of Lunesta. I am having the same results as the 2nd Ambien generic. Calling doctor in the AM and requesting something else."""
Clonazepam,Bipolar Disorde,"""I have bipolar 2 with rapid mood cycling occasional suicidal ideations.  After taking citalopram for 12 years for what doc thought was regular depression, I went off that and now searching for mood stabilizer for bipolar moods. 
 Clonazapam 0.5 2x daily helped stabilize my anxiety after all of this and Ativan 0.5 as needed for panic attacks.  Clonazapam is great because it stays in your system much longer than Ativan.  Overall, Clonazapam is a life saver for me (especially at time with PMS moods!)  Still searching for a good mood stabilizer bc I still have &#039;bad&#039; days though but always stay POSITIVE THIS TOO SHALL PASS keep going to your doc and psych!  Peace."""
Phentermine,Weight Loss,"""I have to agree with everyone here. I was prescribed this medication years ago and I lost 2 sizes, got down to a size 10/12 and kept it off for 2 years until I got pregnant with my son. My only side effects were dry mouth, not always wanting to sleep (because I took them too late sometimes) and extreme energy! It was the best medication for weight loss I&#039;ve ever used and now I&#039;m looking to lose the weight again. Although just a note to everyone, if you are going to do something like Ionamin, it&#039;s best to exercise with it...that helps to keep it off. I&#039;m going to see my doctor/nutritionist next month!"""
Medroxyprogesterone,Abnormal Uterine Bleeding,"""I have been on the depo shot since I had my daughter which was 3 years ago. For the first few months I had spotting but that stopped. I still get PMS-like symptoms around the time I would usually get my period. I have gained 15 pounds while on depo. I have been getting bad migranes &amp; terrible aches in my body and I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s because of the shot. I would definitely recommend this shot. There is nothing to remember every day, just show up to the doctor once every 3 months!"""
Ethinyl estradiol / norgestimate,Birth Control,"""I was switched to this from Loryna (generic Yaz) two months ago. I&#039;ve been on some form of BC since age 19 to control horrible cramps and prevent ovarian cysts, and I&#039;m 27 now. Hoped this pill would lessen the ovarian tenderness and stop the weight gain (40 lbs in one year!) I had while on Loryna. Well, I&#039;m horribly gassy and have had diarrhea every day for going on three weeks now of my 2nd pack. It&#039;s clearing up my acne and sex drive is better by a smidge, but my period is a lot longer and heavier, rather than shorter and lighter like it was on Loryna. Cramps are much worse, too, and I feel tired all the time. The crazy appetite increase Loryna gave me hasn&#039;t changed, either. Calling my gyno today to see if I can switch."""
Miconazole,Vaginal Yeast Infection,"""I&#039;ve had my fair share of YIs, and I&#039;ve always used monistat without any major problems but I was on some antibiotics for a few days and as soon as I left the doctor I had this horrible gut feeling that I should&#039;ve asked for a script for diflucan while I was there. I was so uncomfortable and I dished out almost $20 on monistat to basically torture myself. Made my &#039;uncomfortable&#039; YI a living nightmare. Burning, pain, and excruciating swelling. Sitting hurts, wiping myself after peeing hurts, walking hurts. Got my hands on diflucan but now I&#039;m sitting here playing the waiting game wondering why I couldn&#039;t just wait a few more hours instead or why I didn&#039;t google it before I bought it. Didn&#039;t even know a YI could be this painful. Awful"""
Oxycodone,Pain,"""I&#039;ve been on Roxicodone for about two years now and this is the ONLY short acting medication that has worked.  I have been through all the short acting or break through medicines and Roxicodone is by far the greatest.  I am on high doses due to having gastric bypass and not absorbing as a &#039;normal&#039; person would.  I need to have my tailbone removed as it&#039;s broken and swinging around back there.  Not to mention it&#039;s broken at a 90 degree angle or angulated.  INSANE pain. """
Norethindrone,Birth Control,"""I started using Lyza and it has being 2 months. THANK YOU FOR THIS BIRTH CONTROL! I am 23 and its my first time using birth control. I was really scared to get on any kind of birth control but after two babies, it was time to think of it and to take it seriously! I went to my OBGYN and she recommended this pill and it is going pretty well. I get a little bloated after I take it but drinking lots of water makes it a lot better."""
Oxycodone,Chronic Pain,"""I have to laugh when I read some of these comments . Why do I itch ? Because you are taken too much ! Listen I take 7 pills a day of oxycotin 80 mgs and 15 pills a day of roxy 30mgs because a doctor years ago decided it would be the best thing for me and it was the worst thing he ever did to me . I take over 210 80s a month and 450 30s that&#039;s is 660 pills a month yes one month !  I would tell anyone do not take these meds I am so addicted to these now and now with Obama and the DEA against them doctors are being told to take ppl off them well that&#039;s great now I deal with the withdrawal and it&#039;s terrible please please please if you really need the meds take them with caution they become so so addictive doesn&#039;t matter who you are"""
Levonorgestrel,Emergency Contraception,"""I promised myself I will leave a feedback here if the pill works! Here I am, on the first day of my period! I would say this pill really made me emotional unstable. I freaked out, cried and worried a lot after I took the pill. So I started to look for more information online, and it didn&#039;t help at all. Do NOT search for more information! Just relax, try not to think about it and the pill will do its work!! I was so close to my ovulation day which is why I was so worried! I&#039;m so happy the pill worked! Good luck everyone!"""
Propranolol,Anxiety,"""I&#039;m 26 year old male, I used to lead a party animal life i.e. Alcohol, etc. I thought I was invincible through my teens then after 16 years abuse I woke up one morning and felt like I was having a heart attack flared up in the face, tingling down my arms, lack of breath, confusion, hot and cold sweats happened quite often on a daily basis so I went into hospital, did an ECG on my heart then the doctor said you are having panic/anxiety attacks. The flashbacks of my past triggered it. I&#039;ve been put on 80mg slow release beta blocker they work great for me never had a panic attack since. """
Fluticasone / salmeterol,"Asthma, Maintenance","""I&#039;ve been on Adviar for more than 2 years and have had no problems with it.  My asthma developed because of my newly discovered allergy to cats and it has allowed me to keep my pets without any breathing issues.  It did give me some heartburn at first but, since I was overweight, I lost 20 pounds and that seemed to do resolve the heartburn issue."""
Toradol,Pain,"""Presented with sever pain in my left rib cage. This pain started after I bent over to pick up something out of the ocean. Felt a pop which caused sever pain under my left rib cage. Breathing, moving, walking, getting up and down all caused sever pain that made me cry out. On the forth day I finally went to see if a th was broken. The Doctor ordered X-rays and gave me a shot of Toradol in the hip.  Also gave me a script for Percoset which I have not taken yet. Within an hour I had some relief from the pain and was able to breath with only moderate pain. It is now 8 hours later and I still have only a little pain.  So thankful for this medication."""
Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""All bodies are different! I had Skyla inserted last month on the 18th and its been about three weeks with it in. The insertion was definitely painful but nothing that can&#039;t be handled in the 5-10 minutes the procedure takes. I had read a lot of scare stories previous to going. I unfortunately had mine inserted a week before my period. The cervix softens during your period which is the recommended time to have it done. I spotted with little to no cramping for the first 2- 3 days and got my period a couple days later as well. I had some pretty severe cramps on and off the first day or so into my period. It almost feels as though your body is trying to contract it out. My period lasted a little longer but has stopped with no spotting at all."""
Seroquel XR,Bipolar Disorde,"""Been on Quetiapine MR for around 9 months. 300mg at night. Found it far less sedating than Olanzapine. Its been a miracle for my Bipolar, absolutely no depression and no manic episodes. Yeah I put on weight but the effects on my mood and mental health have been incredible."""
Amoxicillin / clavulanate,Skin or Soft Tissue Infection,"""I have adult acne and rosacea due to pcos. I have redness, welt type acne, rash type scne, black/white heads on my face. When taking Augmentin, all my skin problems dissappear within 2-5 days and my face stays clear while taking the prescription. Augmentin is a Godsend."""
Levofloxacin,Sinusitis,"""I found this to be a wonderful medicine for my sinusitis. I was on Augmentin for 2 weeks and didn&#039;t completely take away the infection. The Levaquin stopped the infection in 3 days. I have used a number of times and luckily have had none of the problems others have had."""
Aldactone,Heart Failure,"""Didn&#039;t work for me. Muscle aches, itch and most importantly it dropped my blood pressure too low along with the other medication I am taking..pressure was 87/54 ...normally I am 130/70. I was exhausted, tired, weak and constantly falling asleep. This medication was not for me. Called doctor he told me to stop taking it, and this was at 1/2 pill dosage."""
Polyethylene glycol 3350 with electrolytes,Bowel Preparation,"""Prescribed to me for my 50 year colonoscopy.  Did not add any ingredients just the water mix and chilled in the freezer. Taste was like a flat Sierra Mist diluted with cucumber water. First four glasses I  downed no problem. I had three more after that which I paced myself outside of the 8oz every 17 minutes. Finished the whole four liters in three hours roughly, two hours after starting was when the first void hit and afterwards approximately every 15 mins or so until all was clear. No cramping or serious discomfort associated with it, just mild abdominal gurgling and fluidic voids."""
Oxycodone,Pain,"""I had three surgeries in 3 weeks and oxy really kept the pain under control. I have since run out and the Dr. doesn&#039;t want to refill so I&#039;m now suffering along with only Tylenol. :)"""
Tetrahydrozoline / zinc sulfate,Eye Redness/Itching,"""I was working on water coolers, some of the liquid got my eyes. I went to Walmart and bought this product, and it worked great. it got rid of the itching and burning, I was lucky it save me a visit to the doctor."""
Valdecoxib,Pain,"""I was in agony for 11 days after my doctor prescribed a muscle relaxer for intense lower back pain. A friend gave me sample packs of Bextra and the pain was gone within a half day of taking Bextra."""
Mirtazapine,Depression,"""I&#039;ve been suffering from depression since I was in my teens. However, I&#039;ve just been diagnosed with it 1 month ago. I had been having major panic attacks and anxiety issues, so much to the stage I thought people were following me. The doctor prescribed me Mirtazapine which I was rather anxious about taking, due to reviews online. The first night I took it I went to bed and became really twitchy and restless through the night, I had spells where I woke up during the night. After the first night I had the best sleep ever, I slept till late which was rare, I have had a better outlook on life, I still have my low days and times where I don&#039;t want to get out of bed and times where I just want to run away. The doctor has now upped my dose to 30mg"""
Nitrofurantoin,Bladder Infection,"""Only negative experiences I&#039;ve had with this medication are drowsiness (not really an issue if only taking at night as a preventative )and one time I forgot about the avoid alcohol thing and had one drink. I got the worst indigestion and nausea ever and it lasted for days. Otherwise a great medication that gets rid of the urinary tract infection as a treatment and has been wonderful as a prophylaxis to keep UTI&#039;s at bay."""
Reclast,Osteoporosis,"""Received dose at 11am, by 10pm that night I had fever,chills, severe pain in back. I was extremely ill for 3 days, such a severe headache I couldn&#039;t open my eyes. A week later my hands suddenly swelled to the point I could not use them. Now nearly 3 months later I am in physical therapy to try to regain the strength in my legs. Other side effects were less severe, such as jaw pain for a few weeks. I would never ever take this medicine again."""
Morphine,Chronic Pain,"""Kind of useless on the pain I&#039;m in, was on it for 7 months, 4x a day   2x30mg ER and 2x30mg IR and I was still in pain and coming off it was a process. I never once took it other than prescribed and there is no doubt in my mind I was physically addicted to it. I weaned myself off for months to the point I was taking 1/4 a pill right when I laid down just so it did not feel like my skin was crawling as I tried to sleep. This is an addictive and useless pill for sciatica issues in my experience."""
Drospirenone / ethinyl estradiol,Birth Control,"""This is the absolute worst birth control you could possibly take. I was on Ocella for one month before I had to switch pharmacies due to my new insurance and Ocella was fine. Once I started on Zarah, I had constant anxiety/palpitations. It got so bad to the point that I was seeing my doctor and thinking that I had a heart problem (had an echo done, normal). This birth control literally made me feel like I was going crazy and that I had all kinds of health problems. It made my left hand tingle, and I was also constantly exhausted to the point where I was almost sleeping 20 hours a day. OH and my blood pressure sky rocketed. Went off this birth control and got the Skyla IUD. I didn&#039;t get pregnant on this BC which is literally THE only good thing"""
Brimonidine,Rosacea,"""Tried a sample from my dermatologist. Worked wonders on the redness on one cheek. My insurance doesn&#039;t cover it and it is really expensive. If I could buy a 50 gm tube for $200 I would do it ASAP."""
Buprenorphine / naloxone,Opiate Dependence,"""I had it all. Everything people dream of was mine but I lost it all when I started doing Roxy&#039;s. Once was all it took for me to take many oxycodone 30s as I could get my hands on for 3 years. I tried to stop by myself, went to rehab, meetings, counseling, everything. During these 3 years I went from being a loving daughter, sister and friend to a monster. I have been on Suboxone since 4/20/11 and that was the day my life changed. I feel like a normal person again. There is a price to my happiness though I have headaches, am tired very often and experience extreme constipation from the Suboxone. If that&#039;s all I have to go through to be the person I am now than that&#039;s fine. Suboxone literally saved my life."""
Alprostadil,Erectile Dysfunction,"""After having my prostrate removed, I could not get an erection.  Viagra and Cialis did not work.  The next step was injections, which the Dr. recommended Edex.  The injection was painless and I had a great erection.  I had an erection for 6 hours, which I have to tell you, it is not a pleasure, but after reducing the dose in half it&#039;s much better.  I highly recommend Edex.  The Dr. gave me an Edex card, which took care of the co-pay and ended up costing me nothing."""
Klonopin,Anxiety,"""Klonopin has made me the woman I was prior to menopause. I am so very grateful. I could no longer stand the sleepless nights, horrific night and day sweats, constipation, anger attacks, anxiety attacks and bouts of depression. A friend told me about Klonopin. It works without causing any side effects. I pray it continues as I honestly wished to just not exist any longer.

With nothing else to try he sent me to a neurologist who specialized in sleep disorders and RLS.  She started me on melatonin 1 mg at 6 pm, 5 mg at sleep along with pramipexole 0.25 mg in late afternoon if needed and 0.5 mg at 9 PM. WOW.

So far so good and I did notice some minor things in the first 2 weeks but it has gotten easier.  Within the first few day&#039;s my energy increased, my eyes became whiter and what felt like a film over my eyes for years, vanished.  I hadn&#039;t associated that with Hep C before.  My skin seems a little dryer but really.. its been easier than I thought.  I drink lots of water and other fluids throughout the day and that seems to help reduce any side effects.

Blephamide,"Conjunctivitis, Bacterial","""This was a wonder drug for me.  I live outdoors a lot, and I sweat a lot, and so I get bacterial conjunctivitis about once every 3 months.  If I apply just a couple drops when I feel my eyes first getting itchy, this stuff makes it go away overnight.  A couple more in the morning and I am good to go for the next 3 months.  If, however, the eyes get red before you realize you have the conjunctivitis, then it might take multiple applications to make it go away, but it will in a matter of a couple days.  Very good stuff.

Accutane,Acne,"""​Hello everyone,

I&#039;m your typical 18 year old lad and have never written on a forum before but I want to write something for the people that are worried about taking this (in my opinion) miracle drug. I am coming to the end of my 6 month course and I can honestly say it&#039;s been life changing. 

Before I started Roaccutane, I was fairly depressed and seriously lacking confidence due to my appearance. But after months of failed treatments on various antibiotics, I was referred to a dermatologist who instantly said there&#039;s only one way to fix my acne problem, Roaccutane. At first I thought this is the worst case scenario and I&#039;m going to be even more depressed as a result of the possible mental health side affects. Depression has run in my family so I was very worried. However, living like with acne wasn&#039;t something I was prepared to do, so I started the course on 40mg a day.

The first week I had a headache daily, but thankfully these die off after a week and paracetamol and ibuprofen will take all the pain away. Almost immediately, my lips were cracking and from then on in, I never went anywhere without some Carmex lip balm in my pocket.

As the first 3 months went by, I was still breaking out and was starting to think it isn&#039;t going to work. However, I&#039;m so glad I stuck with it because now I haven&#039;t got a single spot of my face and the scars have faded to the point where you can barely see them! After the third month, my derm upped my dose and I started to take 60mg a day. 

Luckily for me I hadn&#039;t had any serious side affects. Just your occasional nose bleed and dry skin, and sometimes my eyes were a bit blurry but it&#039;s not much of an issue.

Anyway, I just want anyone reading this that is worried about starting this medication, that not everyone has a horror story about Roaccutane and I couldn&#039;t be happier at how it&#039;s made me feel!!

     Yes, it is a process to apply it in the morning, albeit a maybe 5 minute process. The best advice is to USE rubber medical gloves to apply, otherwise it is a complete mess to clean up, and USE a metal tube key to get the last 25% out of the tube. Rub it on until it begins drying,(30 seconds maybe) wait a couple minutes to put a t shirt on, and do your thing. I haven&#039;t noticed really any smell at all, certainly not bothersome.

None of these will make me quit taking the medicine, but, I wonder how I will be able to do this for 12 weeks. I really don&#039;t have a choice, my numbers jumped from 4,000,000 to 10,000,000 and have cirrhosis.

So, I have been getting help through a psychiatrist, a therapist, and a depression educational support group, and am learning new ways to cope for my depression and anxiety.  Taking Antabuse helps me resist the urge to take the alcohol way out of my discomfort, and use my new tools.

But its rather tolerable. My Dr told me there&#039;s a trick. Take it after dinner. 
After a couple days I have begun to get terrible restless leg syndrome. Talked to my Dr and he put me on klonopin to take 1 hour after latuda. Last night it didn&#039;t work.

It really is unfair there isn&#039;t a generic for this medicine after all it was on the market since 1996.

My favorite BY FAR is the Nuvaring, my side effects are minimal and include general birth control side effects such as thickening mucous and bloating. I am not moody nor has it made me gain weight. Compared to other birth control the needle (Depo) made me bloated and cranky and I felt very uncomfortable, the patch was alright. I was not a fan of having it stuck to my body for a week at a time but it would be my second favorite.

If I don&#039;t drink a lot of water (20 oz or more) with each dose, my urine is very dark, which is scary, but drinking more water does help.  I agree with the comments that you should eat a full meal with each dose, even at bedtime.  It is rough doing the schedule and getting in the food, water and pills four times a day.

Side effects for me include dizziness (if I take it without food), drowsiness, slight insomnia, dry mouth, and euphoria or a floating feeling. I cannot drive or do anything requiring intense concentration after taking this medication. That said, I am sensitive to the effects of medications. Although there are some side effects, overall this medication helps me a lot and allows me to deal with pain more easily."""
Etonogestrel,Birth Control,"""I had Implanon inserted in August of 2010. Other than a really nasty (but painless) bruise on my arm for about a week I haven&#039;t really had any problems. The only time it hurts is when my daughter pinches my arm right where the device is, but obviously that isn&#039;t because of the birth control. Almost every time after intercourse I would have a period, which for me isn&#039;t all that big of a deal, I had irregular periods before I was pregnant. BUT, they don&#039;t last but a couple of days and they are very light and cramp-free. Please don&#039;t let the negative reviews scare you out of this birth control. After being on the Depo shot for almost 5 years, I wouldn&#039;t give up my Implanon for anything."""
Supartz,Osteoarthritis,"""Injection was virtually painless. Noticeable decrease in pain within hours of first injection. It&#039;s now been 5 days and I&#039;m pleased with results."""
Euflexxa,Osteoarthritis,"""Don&#039;t bother wasting your time with Euflexxa. I have been diagnosed with moderate osteoarthritis and Euflexxa only made my condition worse. Now I am stuck with a sore back, I can hardly bend over, my limbs have no flexibility and are sore as heck. I don&#039;t get it. The treatment did not even come close to doing what is was described as. My doctor told me that the fluid only stays in your knee about two days and then it is gone. It is not described that way on the Euflexxa web site. It says it hardens into a gel then forms a cushion between your bones. My experience is that this is NOT true. And how much am I paying for this ??? Don&#039;t bother spending your money on Euflexxa. Your money is better spent on a partial or full knee replacement."""
Acetaminophen / butalbital / caffeine,Headache,"""My son has suffered with severe migraines since the age of 8 when he was diagnosed with seizures. For the better part of the next 9 yrs. I had to watch him suffer because we were told there was nothing to be done other than diet, etc. No one wants to see their child suffer! At last we found a wonderful doctor who first prescribed Midrin, which really helped, but then of course insurance didn&#039;t want to pay for it anymore and suggested Fioricet. 2 pills at the most and I have my happy son back!"""
Mirena,Birth Control,"""32 years old, Two children: Admittedly I am only 1 month into having the Mirena but after reading all the negative reviews I have to share my experience so far.
Yes, there was some discomfort when it got put it. There is a pinch, some pain &amp; some cramping. But it passes &amp; can be aided with a heat pack &amp; pain killers. During the insertion I was offered a sedative or laughing gas. I had neither &amp; managed just fine.
I think it&#039;s important to remember EVERY woman is different - different bodies, different tolerances &amp; take into account age, health, fitness &amp; so on. I&#039;ve noticed my breasts ARE swollen a little but not sore. I am currently having my first &quot;period&quot; since insertion - light spotting &amp; little actual bleeding.
I feel great so far!"""
Loestrin 24 Fe,Endometriosis,"""This pill has been awful for me.  My doctor prescribed it after my laproscopy and a period of induced menopause due to endometriosis. It has caused major moodiness and I either get my period when it is not supposed to come or don&#039;t get it at all.  Slight weight gain.  My breasts hurt all the time, more than ever!  I asked my doctor to switch me to something else.  He put me on Notrel 777- and that is great!  Hope everybody can find something that works well for their body."""
Buprenorphine / naloxone,Opiate Dependence,"""I had a MIRACULOUS recovery in 1996 from Kaposi&#039;s Sarcoma when treated with Doxil. This was in the early days of Doxil (and all liposomal chemos) was only approved for Secondary Treatment Options. Conventional chemo (AVB) did nothing; Doxil completely eradicated the neoplasms. It also left me with NASTY throbbing pain in the arches of my feet which never completely went away. I was hooked on so many opiates (both for the pain and the mental anxiety relief they provided) that I didn&#039;t even realize I was an addict until I ran out of Percocet one dark day. 16 years later, the foot pain returned. My doctor prescribed 2mg Suboxone and I have my life back. Unorthodox, but legal and no longer a junkie. No &quot;highs&quot;, no pain, and GRATITUDE."""
Levonorgestrel,Birth Control,"""So I&#039;m reading all these wonderful and not so great reviews about Skyla, what I got mostly is that you&#039;ll have mild pain if your not so lucky and major discomfort. I had mine inserted on March 7th and lord let me tell you, I have high pain tolerance (EXTREMELY HIGH). I took two extra strength Tylenol (800) and it didn&#039;t do a dang thing. Yes god I felt that plastic being inserted and when she measured my cervix? Yeeeeeeeeeesh the pain, but after that it was just discomfort. As of now I feel light cramping and no bleeding plus vaginal discomfort like I have a UTI. All in all, I&#039;m not giving up on Skyla nor saying it&#039;s bad it&#039;s just the insertion that got me."""
Meperidine / promethazine,Pain,"""I found this medicine very useful for pain.  I had my ankle operated on and they prescribed this to me. I have to agree with most of the reviews.  I felt little to no pain but I slept all the time and now when my ankle becomes painful I will take a pill and I have to lay down.  My mouth stayed dry the whole time, I couldn&#039;t get enough liquids in me."""
Belviq,Weight Loss,"""I didn&#039;t think Belviq would work but tried it anyway.  Now I have lost 30 pounds or 15 percent of my weight.  I now believe hard to lose weight is a thing of the past for me!  Thank you Belviq."""
Xanax,Panic Disorde,"""Panic disorder is no fun. You feel like you have nowhere to run and nowhere to hide, and that you are coming to an end! Xanax has helped me against this terrible nervousness, demonic, feeling. I only take it when I truly need it. I take the lowest dose possible 0.25. The thing about this drug is that it makes you feel so relaxed. So people keep taking it, to keep feeling good and that&#039;s when it backfires. Please only take it as needed. Don&#039;t take it if your not feeling panic at the moment. You have to respect this drug. And taking it when u don&#039;t feel panic is not the way to go. Trust me! Prayer and a lil help from xanax can make all the difference in the world!!"""
