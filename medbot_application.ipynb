I reported this to my doctor and he recommended cutting the pill into 3 parts.  Now I take 1/3 every other day with no side effects.  Erections are strong and last as long as necessary.

Feeling anxious whether I would perform properly or not, worsened my condition and I started using a 20mg pill in four pieces (5mg). By now, I have used it only twice and the results were beyond my expectations. No side effects at all and my erection brought memories of my early 20s back.
