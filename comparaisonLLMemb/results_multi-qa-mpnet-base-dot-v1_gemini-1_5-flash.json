            "question": "What should I know before getting a ParaGard IUD?",
            "answer": "Before getting a ParaGard IUD, be aware that insertion can be painful, with experiences ranging from \"worst pain ever\" to \"uncomfortable but bearable\" to painless.  Some find taking pain medication beforehand helpful.  Following insertion, expect cramping and/or spotting, with heavier and/or longer periods than before being common, though the severity varies greatly among individuals.  The intensity and duration of these side effects seem to lessen over time for many users.  A small percentage of users experience severe side effects like contractions, vomiting, and fainting.  Choosing a provider experienced in IUD insertion may lessen the pain of the procedure. Getting the IUD inserted during your period may also reduce pain."
