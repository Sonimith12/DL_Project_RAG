Pain during insertion itself has also been described as ranging from a 2-3 out of 10 to extremely painful.  Ibuprofen and heating pads may help alleviate post-insertion cramping.  Heavier and longer periods are a common side effect, though some individuals experience no change or only slight changes in their menstrual flow.  Spotting is also possible.  Consider choosing a doctor experienced in IUD insertions.  Getting the IUD inserted while on your period may help."
