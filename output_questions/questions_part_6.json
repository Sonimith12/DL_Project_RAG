However, the reviewer noted that methadone resulted in a lack of sex drive, while buprenorphine/naloxone caused difficulty climaxing for both the reviewer and their partner.

Another review mentions being on a methadone program for 20 years and relapsing, then switching to buprenorphine/naloxone and finding it better, though they also received counseling.  A third review describes methadone as its \"own evil\" and suggests that any opiate other than buprenorphine/naloxone is better due to buprenorphine/naloxone's potential for brain and organ damage.

A third review reports that methadone treatment made the user feel awful, while Suboxone, though initially difficult, is hoped to provide relief.
