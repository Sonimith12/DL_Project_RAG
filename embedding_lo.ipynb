It helped me stay focused on any tasks I started to completion. I took it for more than a year but had to stop because was too expensive for me even with insurance. I had some side effects that I mentioned to the company Lilly. These side effects were slight dizziness, nausea if taken without food, hair on the back of my neck would raise sensation, and some stomach discomfort, but the worst was the size of my penis would decrease incredibly while flaccid (normally 3 inches, but after medication, about 1 inch or less) and would take a lot of stimulation to get an erection.\"\n",

The side effects are pretty much gone so far, I have been getting sour stomach, but I started a pretty good probiotic - 9 strains 50 billion bacteria- and it&#039;s helped some. I&#039;ve been on the xr for 3 days now. I can&#039;t say much for it being consistently effective though, it&#039;s also much more subtle as far as focus/concentration goes, and it seems to wear off much sooner than its supposed to, though it&#039;s hard to tell.

Atarax was one that I had never heard of, till the doctor prescribed it to me.  Immediately it works.  You take it, and within 30 mins it kicks in, and last for hours.  You can take one or two at a time, every six hours.  The only side effect is sleepiness, and I did experience this.\"\n",
      "Context 8: Drug: Metronidazole | Use Case: Trichomoniasis | Review: \"The taste is absolutely terrible!!! It&#039;s so strong and disgusting! If you let it hit your tongue, your screwed!!! What I do, is I take it with a huge glass of milk, fill your mouth up with milk, drop it in and swallow! Sometimes it works and you don&#039;t taste anything but milk, but sometimes it floats around and hits your tongue! Besides how bad it tastes, I get super dizzy after taking this pill, almost immediately I am dizzy and nauseous with a nasty headache! Of course it helps if you eat before hand, but the lightheaded, dizzy feeling isn&#039;t fun at all! Feels like I have my eyes crossed, it&#039;s painful. Although the side effects are horrible, I do have to say within hours the discharge completely flushes out, the smell goes away and your back to norm!\"\n",
      "Context 9: Drug: Metronidazole | Use Case: Bacterial Vaginitis | Review: \"The side effects of this medication were hard to deal with-occasional nausea, moodiness, blurry vision, and the worst side effect by far was the drowsiness. It was hard to even get out of bed a lot of days and had no motivation to do anything.\"\n",
      "Context 10: Drug: Acetaminophen / hydrocodone | Use Case: Pain | Review: \"I&#039;m taking Lortab for the pain from getting my wisdom teeth out. I&#039;m really lucky that I had them because when the anesthesia wore off the pain was unbearable. Since then, I&#039;ve taken one pill or maybe one and a half if the first one didn&#039;t help after an hour or so. That only has happened a couple of times though, and mostly at night. The side effects I got are (listed from most present to rare):  loopiness (like I&#039;m slightly drunk almost), extreme mood swings (I&#039;ve cried multiple times over nothing), itching (mostly on my face, not too much), constipation (only slightly though) and nausea (only the very first time I took them, and with two pills). Overall, worth it. Takes care of the pain.\"\n",
