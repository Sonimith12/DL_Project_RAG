Other potential side effects are more serious and can include changes in blood pressure or heart rate, sleep disturbances,  pain (in various locations such as joints, back, or stomach),  anxiety, tremors, and even worsening of mental health conditions like suicidal thoughts.

Some experience brain zaps.  Ultram ER can lead to dizziness, upset stomach, nausea, lethargy, sleep problems, allergic reactions, itching, and insomnia.
