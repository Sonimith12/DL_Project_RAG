      "Context 4: Drug: Otezla | Use Case: Plaque Psoriasis | Review: \"After failing enbrel and humira, my doc moved me to a different class. Otezla has been a great for my severe psoriasis on the palms of my hands and psoriatic arthritis. I went from 100% coverage with extremely painful lesions, unable to use my hands to 100% clearance, in three weeks. My rheumatologist and I both are amazed with the results. I will put up with the side effects as the massive improvement makes it all worth it. Side effects I&#039;ve had : headaches /migraines, indigestion, stomach pain, loose stools and nausea. All but headaches have started to subside as of my 3rd week in! Very, very happy here!!\"\n",

Up to this point minor side effects but did cause some sleep issues which could also be contributed my upcoming surgery. Had such good results with Biologicals for 15 yrs. until they lost there effectiveness. Now as I get older 67 would like to try something less immunosuppressive. Not encouraged by comments I read. But everyone is different so I will stick it out for four months\"\n",

I did every topical, several drugs and even a uv light to treat it. Once it spread to my body I had had enough and was put on this medication. It has almost cleared up my psoriasis completely, and it works fast. However the side effects for me have been horrific. I am terribly nausous and have diahrea literally every time I take it, this subsides within the hour and I can carry on with my day. Yes it&#039;s horrible and I&#039;ve considered stopping the medication; however the fact that I haven&#039;t should be proof of just how well it works.\"\n",

So 40 years of trying all kinds of topical medications, cortisone creams, sun light and UVB treatments, Dead Sea Trips and eventually Methotrexate. 6 months ago, my Dermatogist suggested I try Otezla. My Insurance \n",
      "refused to pay for it and suggested all kinds of Biologic medications.  I refused the Biologic meds after reading of dangerous side effects. Otezla approved me on a temporary Bridge program while we are fighting the Insurance. Initial results were astonishing. Both the Arthritis pain and the Psoriasis were gone! I stopped taking the Methtrexate. About 3 months after I started taking Otezla, some Psoriasis patches came back, though the Arthritic pain is minimal.\"\n",

Eventually though, my body started making antibodies against the Humira, and it started working with less efficacy. I then switched to Otezla. I once did a trial study of a pill version of a ps med (the only one I had ever heard of at the time), and it worked great, so I was pretty hopeful as I started Otezla. \n",

      "For me, I could literally feel the Humira leaving my body. For those of you with bad ps, I started feeling those pins and needles again. I gave Otezla almost 6 months before calling my Rheum doc and asking if I could try something else and here I am. I&#039;m not scaling a ton, but I&#039;m constantly itchy (hard to sleep). I&#039;ve tried a lot and some have worked. For me, Otezla doesn&#039;t.\"\n",
